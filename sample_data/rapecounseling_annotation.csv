eib762,Need Help as the Spouse,1b,help-seeking,1,"My wife was raped about as a teenager, before we started dating.  Fast forward and her assailant is now facing multiple charges from other girls within the past few years (my wife was attacked nearly 15 years ago).  She is not an accuser in the trial.

She is dealing with a mess of emotions that i am trying my best to help with.  The recently diagnosed PTSD from the attack (nightmares, panic attacks), guilt for not speaking up 15 years ago, stress with the possible outcome of the trial, and others.  

Two over arching questions.

1) What can i do that a non victim wouldn't think of to help her cope/get through hard patches?

2) I need help dealing with her dealing with it.  She is coping by going out more often and sometimes real late (latest 5am).  She frequents a local pub.  I can get it intellectually; being in a bustling crowd with people untethered to the issue can help to forget, feel normal, and the like.  I'm having trouble though.  Is this a normal coping mechanism and should I be concerned?",wubbalubbadubdub_1,1,0,6,2020-01-01 0:15:37,rapecounseling
eic3r1,I don’t even know what to call this and the fact that I was drunk doesn’t help me define what happened. Drugged? Maybe. Raped? I think so. I feel gross.,1a,rant,2,"I was travelling in Costa Rica and went out with people from the hostel I was staying at. We all were drinking and went out to this local bar in the town. I remember going inside the bar and dancing with 2 local women and taking a shot with them. We went back outside and were all talking in a group of locals &amp; travellers. Everything then turns black. 


Fast forward to the next morning.... I am in a house in the middle of the forest with no doors, or windows laying on a mattress on the floor naked, in a pile of my own feces.  There’s nobody in the bedroom and I start panicking trying to find my clothes and get the hell out of there... I walk out of the bedroom and there is a local Costa Rican man sitting on his couch, also naked. I stumbled out in shock. I don’t know who this person is or what he’s going to do to me. I asked him to tell me where my clothes are, he didn’t help me find them so I started walking around looking for them.... my clothes were outside on his driveway.



I was extremely scared and wasn’t sure how to comprehend what happened and I felt still drunk. I didn’t know where I was but from when I was outside looking for my clothes, I feel like I was in the country. 



I may have not remembered the sex that took place but I feel still violated to this day and my views on sex, rough sex, anal sex does not interest me at all. I’m really sad about what happened.

I was raped and abused in 2015. I also lost two grandparents two months apart that time in the Spring, and my assailant used my grief to make advances on me. 2020, with the exception of January and February, has the same calendar year as 2015, which is a huge trigger for me when I think about it. Anniversaries are the same day of the week, and timing and seasons are a big part of my triggers. It just seems too close to me.

I also have been hating seeing stuff about how apparently everything is more special because it’s a new decade, and everyone is starting fresh. But I just feel like I’m going to be stuck in the past.

I’m in therapy (both abuse and grief) to navigate this, but I feel so alone with only my two therapists, my older brother and his girlfriend, and only two friends knowing about this.

pretty drunk but not heavily. My friend left. I didn't call an Uber b/c the rate was around $100. So I waited until it went down.
This guy I made friends with who I thought was gay hung out with me. At no point did I come on to him. Like ZERO.

He said he was getting a hotel and I could hang there.
At the hotel he kept trying to touch me and rub up on me. I said to stop and he kept doing it b/c he probably thought I was too drunk to notice. I keep remembering the feeling of his hard you know what on my body.

I've been raped in a hotel room a few years ago so I was afraid and I told him I lift weights and could kick his ass kindly. I arm wrestled him to show I was stronger lol.

At 4AM Uber prices were around $20 so I left and he was upset saying ""but I got this expensive hotel"". I just told him I didn't ask him to do that.
I wake up to a message from him saying happy new year friend with hear eye emojis.

You are a selfish bastard and i hate you. You have invaded my life completely. All my nightmares are you. All my flashbacks are you. Every knock on my front door is you coming to hurt me.

You got mad at me that our friends abandoned you, that they don’t trust you, that they blamed you and not me. Fuck you. I was asleep and you were sober. I don’t even have complete memories for most of that evening. You commented on how drunk I was. You commented on how you were babysitting us because you were only buzzed. I only know that because that’s what my friends said you said. I was shitfaced and you were not. Fuck. You.

ej8a2x,My (20M) girlfriend (19F) was sexually assaulted last night and I don’t feel equipped to handle it. I feel like an absolute monster,1b,help-seeking,2,"My (20M) girlfriend (19F) told me she was sexually assaulted, I believe her and want to be there for her 100%, but I don’t think I can continue dating her

About 4 months ago I met this amazing girl in class. Smart, funny beautiful yada yada I’m sure everyone gets the gist. We’ve been dating for about 3 months at this point and the relationship has gone really well and it’s been probably the healthiest relationship I’ve been in. She’s great and it’s been great. 

Well Christmas break started and we both went to our respective homes with no change in the relationship status as it was only three weeks. We’ve been keeping in touch and everything still has been great. Then New Years. 

Yesterday she texts me and says that on New Year’s Eve she blacked out and woke up next to a guy she didn’t remember sleeping with and he said that they had sex. Which she didn’t remember. I have no clue who any of these people are or what had happened at the party so I’m solely relying on her word. She said she woke up with bruises and was sore with no memory. I have no doubt that someone took advantage of her and want to make sure some justice happens. 

This is where it gets tricky. I wasn’t angry at all because how could you be in this situation? But when I tried to get her help or take action she flat out refuses to. She’s not going to go to the doctor or a therapist until she’s back at school (about a week at this point) and overall has been pretty nonchalant about the whole thing. This isn’t the first time she’s gotten blackout and bad things have happened, but nothing even close to this bad. 

I don’t take this stuff lightly as I’ve been assaulted myself and know how terrible it was. I really want to make sure she’s okay. This is terrible and I don’t know what to do especially from 2000 miles away and I can’t talk with her in person. I feel like a monster because I couldn’t do anything to stop it or help in anyway. I know it’s completely normal for survivors to not want to go about things afterwards, but her complete nonchalance to the assault and her only worry being if I’m angry just strikes me the wrong way. I think she was taken advantage of, but I really am a believer of drunk actions being sober thoughts. I’m here to support her 100% and will always be close with her, I just don’t know if I can continue dating her. I don’t feel well equipped enough to deal with this and I don’t know if I can continue dating her. 

I know this makes me a monster and a victim blamer, but I don’t know what to do. I feel like I can’t get a straight answer and have these terrible thoughts she’s lying to me but I really think it’s important to believe women and support survivors. I don’t know what to do and I feel like a monster on so many levels. I don’t want to question her or try to invalidate her, I don’t want to push too hard or not support her, but I just don’t think I can help this from the angle of a romantic partner. 

What should I do?

ejjzb3,[TW] Hallucinations during intimacy. How to deal,1a,help-seeking,1,"Question:

How do I stop seeing my abusers face when I'm with a loved and safe romantic partner?

Backstory/ Explanation

My ex left me partially because I made a disgusted face at him, and because needed lights on when we were going to have it. This only started several years into our relationship and over a decade after the abuse. 

Yesterday I took off my glasses while face timing a friend. Suddenly I saw the wrong face. I clutched my chest and started rapid, shallow breathing. I don't know how long I was like that before my friend asked if I was ok. It was probably only a few seconds but I was not so aware of my surroundings and when I came back I was in a fog like I'd just woken up. He has PTSD so I am sure he knew what he saw. 

How can I stop this from happening?

I used to get triggered from really small things-- like having a computer in the bedroom-- but that's mostly over albeit I haven't tried another real relationship since my ex 2.5 years ago.",turkaturkat,2,0,2,2020-01-03 19:04:49,rapecounseling

Now, I have seen her a few times since i came back from Bangkok, where I (23m) was on a holiday for the last six weeks with my best friends (23f)  in an  around that favorite place of mine. She seems to be between 16 and 18, I  am not sure. I've never asked her. She is red haired, quite pretty if  quite rough on the edges. She was always wearing the same clothes, too  thin for this weather. People are constantly bullying her and throwing  her out, even though she just wants a bit of warmth. I heard some awful  stuff surrounding her, like that she was thrown out of her home  by her  parents for attempting an arson, that her father has made her mother  disabled (she said this herself once), and some ppl are saying that she  has been forced to do blowjobs and smoke and sell weed to stay alive in  the winter. Now, I really dont care about these last two things, ppl  will do whatever necessary to survive, and if it is true I do not blame  her. What I want is some advice how to best help her. While I could  approach her myself and offer her some shelter, she might think i am just one of the guys  trying to manipulate her, or worse.Also, my family has recently taken tenants so we dont have a place for her , else I would offer her one. I could also sic the social services on  her,but that could backfire, especially if she has some kind of police  record or something. I have a friend who is a president of a small  charity agency, but she might not take me seriously as we became kinda  distant over the last year, and she would need more info. I could also  just sit and watch her be abused by everyone around her, some of them  even her peers, which would hurt me immensely, and wouldnt solve the  issue either. I was also thinking of asking the heads of my uni to  organize some kind of a public action to help her, but they might not be  receptive as she is not a student or family to one. Either way,I think  something should be done ASAP, before she is raped, forcefully overdosed  or something. 

I really want to find a way to actually make a difference, as it breaks my heart to see her alone in the winter in the middle of the big city, with everyone just pushing her around and doing who knows what else to her when i don't see it.",The-First-Watcher,2,0,12,2020-01-04 1:18:45,rapecounseling

I was talking to my best friend cousin who is also currently 7 and a half months pregnant and she was telling me some secrets were being spilt and that one of my cousins was raped by one of our uncles. Then apparently the conversation diverted towards my father being the culpable party of this. MY FATHER.
We were both sick in real time as she was unfolding the information to me she didn’t know who it would be until she found out. 
I don’t know what type of proof their is or who is saying what but they are saying they are going to beat my dads ass when they see him and I just can’t allow that to happen to him if he’s guilty or innocent. I can’t allow for him to walk into something like that without knowing what’s happening. Except I’m not even supposed to know, so I can’t even ask my father for answers unless all of this unravels.

The other fucked up part is that everybody is so willing to believe it’s my dad because it’s easier for all of them to accept that reality over anything else. This cousin is not reliable and comes from a fucked up family that would do something like this in the past.

ek6fgp,sort of assaulted by a friend and it still messes with me,1b,rant,2,"This was about two years ago, i’m not gonna get into details but to put it shortly, it was a night out with some friends, crashed at a friend’s place with another friend, drunk, a little high, had a couple benzodiazepines for anxiety which in hindsight was a terrible choice. We slept in the same bed, some stuff happened that was consensual first and then it wasn’t, but a lot of it is just bits and pieces in my memory because i basically passed out.

Afterwards i felt like shit, he’d already left in the morning when i woke up, i got myself checked out but everything seemed fine physically. I talked to a couple friends about it, he somehow heard and accused me of making shit up.

A couple weeks later i saw him at a party and talked to him about it. It didn’t go too well, i didn’t really wanna make a scene and i hate confrontation, so he basically tried to convince me it was all consensual and it was just a misunderstanding, and i basically ended up apologizing for overreacting.

We were sort of friends again after that i guess, although being around him or just in same group chats with him made me a bit uncomfortable, but i kinda just tried to deal with it. Then a friend in the same group started dating him, she knew about what happened but it didn’t really affect her i guess, and she also talked about their relationship a lot (including a pic in our smaller group chat about some marks he’d left on her in bed and i wanted to throw up) and i’m still not sure if my feelings were justified in any way, especially since we weren’t like super close friends, but i still felt betrayed because of the whole thing.

Then that summer he sent me a friend request on facebook which really took me off guard because it kinda proved how little what happened meant to him since he assumed we like, really were still friends, like nothing ever happened. The next few weeks are kind of a blur, i basically just remember being constantly in sort of a fight or flight mode, like having a panic attack that lasted for like a month. I eventually deleted his friend request and pretty much started avoiding all of my friends.

About a year ago i went to a christmas party at a friend’s house, still this same group of friends because i hadn’t actually cut them off or anything. He was there, like i kind of assumed he would, but i tried to deal with it, kinda just drinking and talking to other people and avoiding him while still pretending everything was fine. I ended up feeling really sick and idk if it was all that stress and anxiety or just drinking or something else, but then i just ended up going home after a couple hours

I haven’t seen him since, i haven’t really talked to him since although i don’t think he even realized why that is or that my distance has anything to do with him. I’m still in a couple same group chats with these friends but we barely talk, and i saw them just a couple times last year. It’s so hard, not really being friends with them but not really being not-friends with them either? And the main reason is still him, he’s kinda just always around and i can’t be around him and i can’t talk to him so there isn’t really any kind of closure.

What kinda makes it harder is that one of my best friends died last year. She was the only one in this group who really got me and had my back through this whole thing, and for a long while she was really the only reason i stuck around. And partly why i still haven’t actually cut them out of my life, because losing them feels like losing another part of her.

And i guess it’s not really fair either, but part of me blames and resents him even more because by avoiding him so much i feel like i missed out on a lot of opportunities to spend more time with her.

I don’t really talk about any of this to anyone. A while back i mentioned to my then psych nurse that i think i might have ptsd, but then i started seeing the new one and that remains the only time i’ve talked about it to any kind of mental health professional. And it’s so hard to bring it up again to someone else so i kinda just keep it to myself while i feel like it’s slowly killing me inside.

And this whole thing feels stupid because it feels like nothing really happened, nothing worth getting this worked up about, and maybe whatever did happened was my fault anyway?

Also i hate that it’s messing with my orientation too, because i already sorta thought i was ace before and i actually mentioned it to him that night and his reaction was not great, so since then i’ve been struggling even more to accept it and accept myself. It just kinda feels like the whole term is ruined for me now because all i can think of is what he said and what he did and if it was because of the ace thing.

Sorry i kinda went off there a bit, i didn’t mean to make this post this long and i don’t know if any of it even makes sense.

ekgesu,My Rapist Gave Me Herpes,1b,rant,2,"I was raped two days before Christmas. He lied about putting on a condom, he even left the room and pretended to put one on. After he came back I even asked if he had one on and he said yes. He then aggressively assaulted me, leaving bruises and scratches and he finished inside of me. Fast forward to two weeks later I had to go to the ER in the middle of the night because my vagina hurt so bad. I could barely walk. At the ER they testers for everything and said I most likely had herpes. I refused to believe this because I also had a really bad yeast infection and a UTI so I thought the extra pain was just from that. A couple of days later I got a call from the ER saying I had test results in. I called back and they said yes you tested positive. And it took them way to long to figure out which test was positive since there were so many done. After finally figuring it out, the lady tells me I should tell the person I slept with, which was just an extra punch in the gut. 

This was not my first rape, but it is by far the worst. I feel so incredibly lost and embarrassed and I don’t know what to do now. I’m on antibiotics for pretty much everything but there is no cure for herpes. I really feel so incredibly lost.",smnappy,1,0,2,2020-01-05 17:57:20,rapecounseling

I can't tell anyone in real life. I'm falling behind in school, I'm just struggling in general. My grandparents invited me to great wolf lodge my mom said yes but my dad said no.

I just told my parents about one of my rapes recently because I was so afraid to tell them before. while they were surprising supportive of me when I initially told them, being there to talk with me. They don’t really realize the lasting effects of the rapes I have encountered. Even when I have attempted to tell them that especially now I am sensitive they don’t really understand. I took a risk in telling them, because they have minimized /dismissed my depression, adhd, and anxiety in the past. This  all just makes me even more anxious when I talk to them, as they think I’m just overly sensitive for no reason really.

I wouldn’t move. I was trying to laugh it off. But I knew something bad was coming. Then they got a hold of me. Manipulated me into positions and I fought. I was scared. I couldn’t verbally tell them no because I was so scared. I eventually just stopped and whimpered while my stomach was pressed against the bed. I felt so unbelievably small. I couldn’t stop anything. They had the ability to make me feel things that felt bad and I couldn’t do anything but whimper into the sheets and hope it would stop...it didn’t. It went on for so painfully long.

ekymer,"I (25M) think i cured my rape trauma and ""fetish"" by going online and finding someone to do it again. Is this sick?",1b,help-seeking,3,"I (25M) was sexually abused almost daily as a kid from age 6 to 12, by an older man. I wouldn't call it ""rape"" because he didn't actually force me, he just taught me how to do everything and I never really existed. This led to me, at age 13, to start hanging out with older men who gave me alcohol and weed in exchange for sexual favors, because it just came naturally to me.


 At 16 I was literally raped, strangled for 2 minutes , by one of these men who gave me shots of alcohol and got me kinda drunk, I wasn't wasted. Before I went to his house, I told him I did NOT want to get effed that night and he agreed and promised. But all of a sudden when I got there, he violently threw me on the ground and did it anyway. I remember his arms were around my neck while he was behind me on the floor, and my eyes were wide open but I couldn't see anything except super bright white light, fading in and out of consciousness. And I had to limp home bleeding after. (He still has 12 more years in prison).


I hated it at the time and it hurt alot, but when I turned 17, I started posting online hookup sites (ONLY WHEN I WAS SUPER DRUNK) that I was looking to be ""real raped, choked"" because for some reason it turned me on in my sick brain after that incident when I was 16. I wouldn't post it all the time , just like once every 2 or 3 months , and mostly did it for the messages . The guys I DID infrequently meet were all just really rough, but respected my feelings when I was in pain, even though I didn't want them to.


2 weeks ago, I posted on Grindr asking for that again. This guy sent me a car to his house, gave me lots of shots and one line of coke, which I had never done before. He choked me harder than the guy when I was 16 and did more stuff ,, you know ,, and I was literally in so much pain because he was using his whole hand, and I was screaming ""OKAY STOP , PLEASE STOP PLEASE, STOP"" and I was yelling so loud , and so much, and he only stopped when he noticed I was bleeding alot. And I was in so much pain almost crying ,, but I wasn't mad at him.


Over the next 2 days I realized that I do NOT want to be raped anymore. I can't go through it again. I feel like I cured myself from that sick fetish, and I feel brand new. It's so weird. I think it worked . Is this crazy???


TL;DR -- I (25M) was abused my whole childhood, and violently raped at 16 by a felon , and then I started having fantasies of being raped again when I was 17. I'm not talking about a fetish, I'm talking of a REAL rape. I found someone to do it violently to me again, a few weeks ago,, and I feel like it cured me of that sick ""fetish"". I don't feel so disgusting now for feeling that . Maybe because this time it was my choice? Is this sick? Do you think this cure will last? Thoughts? It's been weeks now , and the thought of being raped now sounds bad to me.",DanielKush,1,0,0,2020-01-06 19:09:19,rapecounseling
el7fjx,I feel weird around my dad now and he did nothing wrong,1a,help-seeking,1,"Hi, 

I guess I am just hoping to see if anyone can relate or maybe offer some advice.

I was assaulted about a month and a half ago by a middle-aged man. I am staying with my parents over the holidays and I am noticing that now when I am around my dad (an awesome, loving, wonderful, non-abusive, wouldn't hurt a fly dad) I feel really strange. I feel afraid, and I also feel guilty for feeling afraid, because he did nothing wrong, but I *feel* like he did, if that makes sense. My dad pat my shoulder yesterday and I felt so weird. I know logically he is not my attacker, and I have nothing to fear around him, but I just get so nervous. It even feels like he is a completely different person in those moments. It's difficult to explain. I feel awful about it because my dad is the nicest guy in the world. Maybe I am associating him with the rapist because they are similar ages? I feel terrible. I know my dad would feel awful if he knew this, too. 

Any advice, support, or words of wisdom would be appreciated. I just want things to be normal again.

This all started when I was 9, I think. It was only touching back then, and I didn’t really know what to think. I was 13 the first time he raped me. He was 50ish. I try not too, but I blame my parents. They put me right in his hands. I know they didn’t know, so they couldn’t have done anything, but I still blame them.
It happened again and again. It only got worse. I was 15 the first time he tied me down cause I was fighting back. I was 16 when he allowed his friend to join in. I know I should’ve said something, told someone sooner, but I was too scared, too ashamed. I felt worthless. I went to the police when I turned 17. I knew that this would not end till I was dead. Either I would kill myself or he would save me the trouble. They told my parents. My mum supported me from the shadows. My dad was pissed, he’s been accused of rape before(I don’t know what the outcome was, they don’t talk about it). He thought I was lying. His friend wouldn’t do that. At the very least I had lead him on. That broke me, I’d never felt so alone in my life. I decided not to continue with case, it would break me beyond repair. I had no support and I knew I would kill myself, that would’ve been the easy way out. I moved out before I turned 18, I couldn’t face my parents anymore, it hurt too much. I have very little contact with them now.  The Police told me to go to my doctor and organise to see a therapist straight away. Me been the stupid idiot said yeah sure and waited nearly 3 years before going to see one. I thought I was fine, I thought I was in control of my life and body. I got into partying and drinking at 14. It was my way of coping, I treated sex and stuff like that with no emotion. I had to pretend that it was just a thing that happened, but never meant anything. If I told myself sex meant nothing, it meant I could pretend all that abuse wasn’t happening. I could pretend it wasn’t any different to the boy I would get with at a party. 

I got a boyfriend after I moved out and he saved me to be honest. I told him everything and he didn’t leave me. He stayed right beside me, supported me and loved me like no one ever had. It wasn’t easy but we never gave up and always worked out our issues. We even have a healthy sex life, which I didn’t think would be possible. But I still had nightmares, and low moods every now and again, and the PTSD was starting to make its self known. He got me into therapy, at first it was fine. Just paperwork and questions about how your feeling. But today we started getting really into the therapy. And it’s hard. It brings up so many unwanted memories, and reality that I don’t wanna have to deal with. It’s too much and I don’t think that I’m going to cope. My boyfriend has been amazing and is trying his best to make it easier and support me, but I’m terrified. I don’t wanna let him down",Itsahumanthing,1,0,7,2020-01-07 13:35:22,rapecounseling
elf5m6,What happened (was it rape/sexual assault)?,1b,help-seeking,2,"I’ve posted a “was it rape” on here before and got “yes, it was.” I’ve told friends and family and they also say it was rape or at the very least sexual assault, but I keep doubting myself. I keep believing that I didn’t do enough to stop it or that it was my fault, so I want to post it one last time. Hopefully I’ll finally be able to come to terms with the answer.

I let a coworker sleep on my couch because he told me he was too drunk to drive home after a party (I later found out that he apparently lied and was not drunk at all). He and I did a bit of cocaine earlier and I was a little tipsy and high from an edible as well. I had just been doing this as a friend as I didn’t like the coworker and he also had a girlfriend, I even told him nothing was going to happen when he asked to crash. We’re hanging out in my living room and he told me he had a crush on me. I ignored it. He would try to touch me by tickling me or asking to lay on my lap while we watched a movie. I was visibly hesitant and uncomfortable but said okay. Eventually while laying on the couch he got on top of me and tried to kiss me and I put my hand in his face and stopped him and said no. He said why and I said because you have a girlfriend. He then got off of me and we went back to normal. About 5-10 mins passed and we end up going to sleep cuddled on the couch (around 5AM). He knew I just wanted to sleep as I had work in the morning and even told him I was setting an alarm to wake up. Around 7AM (two hours before my alarm) I wake up feeling his hand in my underwear/pants and I just froze. It was a small couch and I was cornered into the back of it. I thought if I just kept my eyes closed and pretended to still be asleep he would stop but he didn’t, he just went further. He tried fingering me and pulled down my pants and tried putting his penis inside me while I was still in a sleeping position, motionless with my eyes closed. I think he got frustrated that I wasn’t moving and so he turned me over and got on top of me and that’s when I couldn’t pretend to be asleep anymore so I opened my eyes and just let him do it. I was tired and I felt really caught off guard and I just wanted it to be over. I also live in a really small apartment and my family were all sleeping and would wake up any minute (he knew this) so I didn’t want to cause a scene. I was in a lot of shock as I really didn’t expect him to try and have sex with me at all let alone not even two hours after I told him I didn’t even want to kiss. After he finished he asked me if I was asleep and I lied and said no because I didn’t want him to feel bad. I’ve felt really traumatized after it happened. I was a virgin and was saving it for someone else. I cry sometimes just thinking about him on top of me/feeling trapped and being around him makes me anxious, but I struggle with calling it assault because I feel like I put myself in that position by inviting him in/sleeping on the couch with him or I didn’t do enough to stop it. I’ve slept on the same couch/bed with male friends before or cuddled with them and they never tried anything so I didn’t think he would especially after I told him I didn’t even wanna kiss.

elmcnz,I used sex to cope with Rape and I'm ashamed.,1a,help-seeking,2,"The title says it all. I was raped when I was 18, at the very beginning of college. Before college, I knew that I wanted to wait to be in a serious relationship before having sex. I was very set on this modesty. 

But in the past two years, I've changed. I counted the number of men I've had sex with.   
Two were serious relationships. Three were casual relationships, but we were together, friends, or otherwise hanging out. One was a rebound after my first relationship ended and broke my heart. One was a date that pressured me into it, even when I said no, and I felt trapped. I did not want to have sex with him but it still happened. Two were just friends. 

I feel so guilty. I feel as though I've made such an incredibly horrible mistake. If I could go back in time, maybe I could understand that I was doing the wrong thing. I feel so guilty. If someone were to ask me about the number of partners I've had, I feel so shameful admitting this. Somehow I thought that sleeping with someone would lessen the rape. Akin to driving again after a car crash. But driving excessively after a car crash your first time behind the wheel.

Im a 16 year old straight guy and i was raped by two men in my own house last weekend.

We met up at my place, drank a bit then took the bus to the city. We were at the bar for around 3 hours untill one of my friends got too drunk and 2 of them had to follow him home, there were three of us left and we decided to all go home. We all live in diffrent places of the city so we had to split up. 

When i was walking down the city omw to my busstop, two guys came with me and asked whats up (i was still very drunk so i was happy to have some company) they were way older than me (around like 23-26 idk) but i didnt mind because they seemed cool. So i told them where i was going and that i was home alone (which i know was stupid). They asked where i live and i told them the area, they said they didnt live far away and said that they could follow me home, and i didnt mind since they seemed cool and i was really drunk.

So we take the bus together and we walk together for a while untill were right outside my house, here is where i kinda get a red flag. They complimented on my house and asked if they could join in, and we could have a ""nachspiel"" or afterparty. I was kinda hesitant and said something about that i couldnt and i had to sleep, but they kept pushing and said stuff like ""its still early"", ""cmon man dont be like that"", so i said we could hang out for an hour and then they had to go (i know i should have said more to stop them). So when we came in they sat down on the couch, pulled out more alcohol they had in a bag and we continued to drink and just watch tv.

We talked casually a bit and they kept giving me beer and a couple of shots even though i was already really drunk. And when they noticed i that i had gotten visibly really drunk, they asked when my family was coming home and if im alone the entire weekend, i said yes. They then started asking if i was gay or bi etc and i said no, i dont remember much but i remember they started asking sexually charged questions even though i had said i was straight. Thats when i realized what was going on, i started getting nervous, and in a drunken response to that nervousness i answered stuff like ""ew im not a f*g wtf"". After i said that, one of them sat closer and started grabbing my thigh, saying ""you sure?"". I tried to push him off but as i said, these guys were way bigger than me and he pushed me way harder down on the couch, after that one of them held me down while the other forcefully pulled off my clothes, i dont wanna get into details

This is one of the worst things ive ever experienced and i cant get it out of my head, it was so painful and humiliating. As i said these guys were way bigger and stronger than me so i couldnt do much to resist. while one of them held me down, they kept hitting md and slapping me, calling me names like ""f***ot"" and other slurs, i was crying and begging them to stop because it hurted so much, but they just kept telling me to stop resisting and it would be over quicker. it lasted about 20 minutes in total i think

i cant write this without crying again, i hate this and i want it out of my head, even though i was almost blackout drunk i remember how it felt so vividly. i cant believe i lost my virginity to this and i feel so emasculated and dirty and humiliated and idk if ill ever be the same. I keep thinking about how stupid i was that let them into my house and didnt stop them, how i couldve prevented it. I feel so tricked and naive, and it was on my couch so everytime im in my living room Ill remember it :( even though it was horrific im so glad they left after they were done, and that they didnt kill me

I havent told anyone and i need someone to talk to or someone to give me some advice or someone whove been through something similar. but thanks for reading",snorkel__,1,0,12,2020-01-08 19:51:19,rapecounseling

It's like my brain is thinking well I already can't sleep without reliving it so why not make sure it's all I think about all day too to the point where I feel like I'm constantly in fight or flight mode.

I could honestly cry right now. I'm so angry at myself and at the same time upset because of all the memories, flashbacks and continued lack of sleep.

em26sl,Was this rape?,1b,help-seeking,2,"So basically when I was 18, I was having an affair with a bipolar girl who did whatever she wanted to me and I was so head up my ass in love with her I went along with it. She also had a much older boyfriend and had given birth to a baby about eight months before we started having sex. 

She and I had sex probably 60 - 70 times. She wouldn't let me wear condoms. She only made me wear a condom a few times, after finding out I had slept with another girl, because in her words ""I'm not catching whatever that little skank gave you."" Most of the time I came inside her. It wasn't my idea, she just wouldn't get off of me, or she would wrap her legs around me. I would bring up my concerns about her getting pregnant and all she would say is ""I'm on birth control why don't you fucking trust me"" or ""You should want to get me pregnant."" 

The first time we slept together, I wore no condom, I tried to warn her I was cumming and all she said was ""You're supposed to, stupid."" 

The thing is, I could have done several things to not cum inside of her. I'm bigger than her and stronger than her. Yet I still did it anyway. I can't figure out if it was rape, but it definitely wasn't my idea to cum inside her. She was very insistent. 

Eventually she did wind up getting pregnant with my baby. It could have been on a night she wouldn't get off me, but there was a night where her nuvaring came out and I came inside her like 10 minutes later. I think that's most likely the night our kid was conceived.

Some I have talked to think she did got pregnant on purpose but I can't figure out why she would. I have no money, we broke up right after she got pregnant and I'm not even that handsome. She had no motive that I can think of, aside from just wanting a baby, but she already had one. Why would she do that? 

The one time I called her out on it, she said ""I'm not forcing you I just helped you figure out what you wanted."" I'm confused and still havent figured out years later whether she was the crazy one or I am.",Green_wagon,1,0,1,2020-01-09 1:07:52,rapecounseling

em8nqz,I was sexually coerced but sometimes feel weird about calling it assault. Anyone else relate?,1b,help-seeking,2,"It was a weird situation. First I said yes to unprotected sex but then changed my mind and said no. I consented to doing other things but then he kept asking again and again to have unprotected sex. I just gave in and said ok. I was exhausted and it was late. I felt pressured to have unprotected sex even though I didn’t want it. 

By definition, asking again and again even after someone says no counts as sexual assault. 

But I feel weird saying I was sexually abused. I still talked to this guy after it happened. I felt like shit about it but I still think about him sometimes. He was one of my biggest, most intense crushes to date. He’s so attractive and probably was never told “no” in his life so he thought what he did was okay (even when it wasn’t). 

I know deep in my heart that he treated me badly and that I deserved to have 100% full control of my body. But I can’t help but think my case sounds more mild compared to other cases. 

My therapist said even though he gave me the option to say no, he put me in a position where my no wasn’t respected. Even though I said no, he still kept begging and saying “I really want to” again and again. 

When I tell this incident to other people, a lot of them don’t think it sounds very serious. But the trauma I felt the next day was definitely real and serious. I know some people who have been raped by boyfriends and I don’t feel comfortable sharing this with them because my case still sounds less severe than theirs. 

I know in my heart that I was assaulted. But there’s always a voice in the back of my head that says “it wasn’t as severe as others” “you could’ve said no more times - he wasn’t the type to physically force you to do something”

emgpeq,Constant Fear of not being believed,1a,help-seeking,2,"So yesterday I was talking to my therapist in our weekly session.  I recently disclosed that I was raped when I was ten.  We’ve talked about it and been working through it.  I’ve never told anyone about it. No one and it happened 20+ years ago.  I’ve been holding it in for 20+ years... So it’s a lot to finally tell my therapist.  But I’ve grown to trust him to feel like I could finally share what happened to me.   I’ve been through some other trauma and a lot of being invalidated, dismissed etc...  Grew up with an emotionally absent father and a narcissistic bipolar mother, divorce, sibling getting involved with drugs etc...  I suffocated my feelings to the point where I have extreme anxiety over expressing my feelings now.  I have also spent my whole life being dismissed and thinking no one will listen to me, no one will believe me, I’m too much, I’m a burden, they have so much going on I can’t possibly add on to it with my problems.  Which turned into, it wasn’t that bad, others have it so much worse, it was my fault, maybe it didn’t happen and I’m just making it up.  So, I’m constantly struggling with thinking I won’t be believed etc...  Anyway, at my session yesterday he asked me why it was still so hard to talk about it after telling him.  I explained to him that talking about it out loud makes it feel real.  He said “but it is real right?” To which I said yes.  I told him that when it’s just in my head I could shut it away for periods of time and convince myself it didn’t happen.  Again he said “but it did happen right?”.  He said that a few more times anytime I said how I desired for it to not be real or convince myself it didn’t happen.  I even said I just wanted to forget it even happened.  I think the purpose was to continue to help me realize it is real and it did happen.  But part of me thinks constantly that he doesn’t believe me and that him asking those questions was because he doesn’t believe me.  So it’s creating anxiety for me.  On top of that I opened this can of worms that is my rape and the plan was to use EMDR but I just found out I’m pregnant and he said it is not recommended to do EMDR during pregnancy so we’ll have to use other methods like talk therapy.  I’m feeling really frustrated with that even though he’s making the best choice for both my and the baby’s well being.  He suggested I start by writing about my feelings around the incident and I don’t even know where to freaking start because I feel so many emotions at once.  It’s a tangled mess.

emhryl,"I need advice on how best to help my friend, who is a victim of both sexual assault and domestic violence",1b,help-seeking,3," Hello!

I   met the friend in question a few months ago when I started university -   she is a third year and I am a first year. Obviously I haven't known   her very long but she is easily the closest friend I have here and she   means a great deal to me. I find it hard to connect with people  sometimes but it was just one of those friendships where the two of you  click instantly. I hung out with her and her family for new years, we go  to the library together, cook dinner together (because we're flatmates  and both vegan), you get the gist, etc etc.

I  have suffered from my own mental health problems in the past and still  do to this day, but my situation has improved a huge amount in  comparison to hers. I thought my life had been pretty rough before I got  to uni but life has chewed my friend up and just spit her out. She has  had an extremely tough go of it the past few years, and I cannot even  begin to contemplate the kind of pain she must be in when her mental   health deteriorates. Without sharing explicit details, because I don't  feel it's my place to say on her behalf, she has suffered both violent sexual assault and  domestic abuse. When I first learnt about this, and learnt that she   sometimes communicates with her ex, it was one of those situations in  which me and our friends gave the ol' ""leave the boy behind!"", ""he ain't  worth it!"", etc. May as well have been quoting good as hell by lizzo to  be fair. The more I've thought about it the more I realise what a  stupid and unhelpful comment that is - she's not an idiot, she knows she  should not communicate with him, but when her mental health is bad and  she's in a crisis the actual communication with him is not as much of a  choice as it is a sign of her breaking down. It's also occurred to me  that the trauma from her sexual assault must be very hard to deal with,  hence why she can't sleep without a night light or some other form of  light on.

While I've dealt with  mental health problems in the past, I feel completely out of depth  dealing with someone else's and the potential fallout of failing, as she  has been suicidal in the past and also committed self-harm. She sees a  therapist but obviously when we're at university her family are not here  alongside her therapist to  provide the specific support she needs, and  the university are useless  if I'm being honest. I am her friend and I  do everything I can for her, but I really need specific advice on how to  help her best, especially in relation to her previous sexual assault  and domestic violence. If there is anyone who knows how best to deal  with victims of both of these acts effectively, I would be so so  grateful.

Any help would be massively appreciated, because I wasn't really sure where else to turn.

TL;DR:  My friend has been a victim of both sexual assault and domestic  violence, and I need advice on how to support her as a victim of both  acts, as she does not receive adequate support at university and I worry  about the potential for her to harm herself.",teganfruit,1,0,0,2020-01-09 23:11:19,rapecounseling

emolib,So confused about this - my therapist says it was sexual assault,1b,rant,2,"I am in therapy for a sexual assault that happened recently, but during the sessions we have also talked about something from my past that I suddenly can’t stop thinking about. It happened ten years ago and I never told anyone. It’s my most shameful memory and I have been trying to forget it ever happened. I always thought of it as something I did, not something that was done to me. But it felt like the assault that happened two months ago, I felt the same kind of fear and shame afterwards. My therapist tells me I was actually assaulted back then, but I don’t think I agree with her. At least I’m not sure. I have written one post about it earlier, I hope it’s ok that I do it again.

I was 18, I was at a club and met 3 guys who were older than me. I think they were in their mid to late twenties. I was very drunk, to the point where I had blackouts, but I think I was having a good time. I agreed to go with them to their house to drink and party some more (stupid decision, I know). I think they were all roommates, but I’m not sure.

I ended up making out with one of them. We went to his bedroom and had sex. I’m pretty sure it was consensual, but it was out of character for me, I only did it because I was very, very drunk. But I participated, kissed him and everything. I think I would have felt ok about it if nothing else had happened. I fell asleep and woke up when his friend entered the room. I was still naked and very intoxicated. I didn’t move at all. He started having sex with me right away, there was nothing leading up to it. I didn’t say no because I didn’t say or do anything, it was like I was paralyzed. I was repulsed by him. I didn’t like it at all. I didn’t look at him, I didn’t move. I couldn’t believe it was happening. Then, afterwards, the 3rd guy came in and started having sex with me too. I was lying totally still, I think I was visibly uncomfortable. I was so disgusted by it, and I finally said “please stop”. He did, and he left the room.

Before leaving the house, I started crying and shaking. One of them called a cab and followed me to the car. The next day I just decided to pretend it never happened. But I think I have been sort of hating myself for it ever since. I still don’t understand why I didn’t say no earlier. But I didn’t say yes either. I’m not even sure how the second and third guy could even tell that I was awake. I was just lying face down, trying to pretend it wasn’t happening.

ems9dj,Rambled monologue of self-doubt and hate because of what happened,1a,help-seeking,2,"I was on a night out with some friends at the end of last year and I ended up taking multiple strong painkillers and not eating after injuring myself getting ready. I'd bought a new outfit and everything so I REALLY wanted to go out, so I trooped on through the pain and didn't even think about eating. So then I ended up drinking way too much, or maybe it was just the painkillers and empty stomach because I don't remember drinking more than usual.   


I started having blackouts, and not just brief but I remember NOTHING from the times in them, and all I know is that I saw a guy friend from college. Then I remember nothing at all, and then I think that I was kissing him, and then I don't remember anything again until I was alone with him in an alleyway and his penis was in me, and I've been blaming myself. Because I remember having to figure out where I was and what was going on. I remember not liking it, and then briefly nothing and then I remember orally trying to finish him off because I wanted him to stop and at the time I thought it was my only out.  


I keep blaming myself, because I drank too much, because I shouldn't have gone out at all with an injury and on painkillers you really aren't meant to drink with, because I used to like him and I must have drunkenly come onto him but I don't remember it. I don't know if he was drunk too but I assume he was, so can I even be raped if we were both too drunk? Except I was drunker than I have ever been, the blackouts were so bad every time I came to during the night I felt as though I'd been unconscious and just woken up even though I know that wasn't the case.  I just don't know how to feel and I blame myself. Why do I have this stupid instinct that says I shouldn't say anything because it might ruin his friendships. Or maybe it'll mean I lose friends and I'm scared.

It would be a lot easier to stamp out campus sexual assault if we just got rid of pesky impediments like the presumption of innocence and right to see evidence against you.

Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, [**the architect**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/post/28072/) of the Obama administration’s campus sexual misconduct policy, is once again lamenting that accused college students aren’t automatically found guilty.

He told a New Hampshire town hall that “English jurisprudential culture” is to blame for the supposed epidemic of campus rape, the [**Associated Press**](https://wpde.com/news/nation-world/video-edited-to-suggest-biden-made-racist-remark) reports.

emyvxv,I was raped by a “friend.”,1b,help-seeking,2,"I’ve only talked about this with a few people, it’s hard to actually make the word “rape” come out of my mouth, like I’m almost embarrassed of it. A few years ago when I was still going to therapy (I really need to start going again) I had this new therapist. I tried to tell her about it, but I don’t think she understood what I meant by “my friend took advantage of me” because all she said was “that sucks when that happens.” I didn’t go anymore after that because I felt discouraged. But I need to tell someone the full story because I think about it too much and it isn’t healthy.
He’s the twin of one of my actual friends. We’d hooked up a couple times before, but as everyone SHOULD know, that isn’t a guarantee that it will happen every time, and it doesn’t give a person a free pass to do whatever, whenever. I had just moved into a new apartment, and didn’t want to be alone on the first night. I invited my “friend” over to stay the night. He came over and almost immediately wanted to get dirty. I told him I wasn’t in the mood, but maybe after some beer. He was persistent though. He asked, “will you suck my dick then?” I said again that I wasn’t in the mood, but maybe later. He replied, “I’ll just have to fuck you then.” At that moment I knew he wasn’t going to take “no” as an acceptable answer. I didn’t say anything, I just let it happen, I gave up. I really don’t remember much, it felt so unreal. He pulled down my pants and started. His belt was banging against the metal bed frame I had, and my new neighbor’s response to that was banging on their ceiling to get us to be quiet. I started crying. Sorry me being raped is irritating you. He didn’t notice I was crying, didn’t even notice I wasn’t moving. He finished and we went to get beer. I said nothing about it until the next day. I texted him, “I feel kind of uncomfortable with what happened, I told you I didn’t want to have sex.” He replies saying that I should have said before he came over that I wasn’t interested in that. Okay, so if I had said I didn’t want to get intimate like that, would he not have bothered coming over? I told his brother what happened a few months later, even though I felt crappy about it. The brother is a great guy, and I felt shitty telling him that. The guy that raped me is/was in my main friend group. After what happened to me was passed around (I gave my friend permission to tell people, I didn’t want it happening to anyone else) MOST of my friends cut him out. However, my lovely friend who I adore but she doesn’t have the best judgement, invited him to her baby shower, which I subsequently did not go to. I’m still a bit angry at her for it, but I never talked to her about it. It is possible that she didn’t even invite him because at the time my then-pregnant friend lived with a few of my rapist’s friends. It’s awful because I know people are still hanging around him, so every time I go to a party or a house show I’m on edge, searching for him in the mass of people. I know a lot of show houses have banned him because of what happened to me but obviously it’s hard to monitor that when there are so many people. There have been three instances where I thought I saw him and had panic attacks. I wish he would move so I can live my life without fear again. I have no clue what he would do/say to me if he saw me. I’m afraid, and I don’t want to be.
I’m posting this to this sub instead of r/rape because I honestly just want someone to tell me that I am heard, and what happened to me wasn’t my fault.

I had to have a fucking an abortion after. my child. that. like. I'm still in therapy, and I even went to Peru to try ayahuasca, but I still can't even begin to talk about it. Anyhwo. i really need your help. god. or anybody else out there. i feel like spiderman swinging through new york city, and I can't cover the whole thing. But I can't believe the circumference from Midtown Manhattan was any more than 20 miles. I know Reddit can help me do this. because if I can figure out where it happened, I can finally put him in jail. I can finally, stop want wating to  be the girl with the dragon tatoo, you know?

My photos from inside the hotel don't offer up the correct exif data for me to figure out which hotel it was. 

But I know if one native New Yorker sees them, who understands why I finally need to do this, truly, understands, and reads my description, they could really, really help me. I know they could help me figure it out. I've been calling hotels along the Hudson river, all night long, and nobody has emailed me back (and I understand it's an odd request; i fucking do).  

So. 

I was picked up in an Uber in Midtown Manhattan. With traffic, it took us 30 minutes to arrive to the hotel. Without, it was more like 15. The lobby had a front desk woman behind a table, sitting down at the front of it, and you went and spoke to her while there was a staircase on the right you waited to walk up. The staircase wasn't a spiral. The lighting was dramatic like all hotels are. 

The rooms wallpaper also looked exactly like New York Hotel 309.

But it wasn't fake brick; it was like a fake woodland scene with still modern applicances. But not just vaneers, small beautiful pieces of striped wood. Felt very hipster and in at the time.

The room was a suite and it opened up into another room, and that had this huge view of the hudson river. Like, on two huge walls. 

This hotel was was so distinctive. Please. I apologize for my grammar. I just needed to get this out. im so tired. i can't keep calling hotels.

en1p5v,my mom knows my brother molested me when i was a child and has never mentioned it since.,1b,rant,2,"when i was younger (honestly i don't even remember the age because i've blocked a lot of it out) my brother would sneak into my room at night and sexually touch me and force me to touch him as well. i was so young i didn't even know it was wrong to be doing these things and i learned years later when i learned what sex was from friends. 

when i was 16 my mom found out i was having sex with my boyfriend and she called me a whore for losing my virginity and i went off telling her i lost my virginity years ago when her son forced himself on me. she said she would ask him if it were true and has never said anything since. 

the next week he cornered me almost forcing himself on me again but i was strong enough to get away because he was drunk and yelling at me why i told our mom and that she would never believe me. 

5 years later i don't see my brother much because he moved to Chicago but holidays are hard because he stays at our house and i don't sleep because of anxiety and fear of him coming into my room. my mom still hasn't said a single THING about this and talks to me about my brother like nothing ever happened.

en24st,I keep reliving it and it feels worse and worse,1b,rant,3,"(This is a post I made in r/rape that for some reason was only visible to me)

I've posted in a different sub a long while ago about how I was making steps of recovery. Well I've gone waaaaay way back so many steps back.

I keep reliving it in my head and in my dreams, and in my dreams it's so much worse and it hurts so damn much. Many times I cant wake myself up and I always wake up scared and into an immediate anxiety attack. There have been times just the dreams and remembrances of it have led me to self harming and thinking of suicide.

Sometimes I tell myself I'm to blame but I know it's not true. I said no.

We were together and throughout the relationship he was constantly wanting sexual things despite me first saying I didnt want it until marriage. I felt I had no choice because of my major depression and I was gullible and stupid, so he was able to get me to think he was all I had and all I could depend on. And it made me so afraid of losing him so I reluctant did sexual things with him. Every time I would stand my ground and say I wanted to stop being sexual in the relationship he would get upset. He would never hit me or yell but he would get down and moping. He would keep bringing it up or put so much guilt onto me that I would say forget it and say I wanted it.

When we decided to have sex the first time it hurt and we stopped cuz I wanted to. When the rape happened it was the same, except this time - i had been heavily turned on by the idea of bondage/bdsm despite having no experience and not necessarily wanting to do it actually irl. We both decided to try just simple hand bondage. Well when he went into me it hurt and I ended up saying i wasnt ready and i wasnt sure. But he didn't stop despite me saying that many times. He didnt stop until I was crying so badly and his mom walked in. She left but I was a horrible mess. I still am. It hurts so bad to think about and i just want to die

He claimed I wanted it despite what I was saying because my body was moving for more. I was trying to push him off without my hands since I couldnt use them.  For the longest time I pushed it out of my mind and told myself it was just due to his mild autism but my friend, who my bf at the time ended up not liking me hang with, had to flat out tell me it was rape before I realized it. And I broke down when I realized my friend was right.

Jeff, the guy who hurt me, I dont care if his name is here it's such a common name no one will know, tried to tell me hes never done this before and he didnt mean it.

I was ready to die after all that. I had gone to a gaming/swimming party to reunite with some old high school friends and almost ended up drowning in the pool while being taught how to swim. Jeff didnt care when I told him. I realized I didnt want to stay with him but I knew I couldn't break up with him in person because I wouldnt be able to go through with it. So I texted him and my two friends comforted me through it that night.

I found out before even this that I'm not the only one hes done this to. Jeff's ex, who he spoke so badly about to me, was actually the nicest person I had ever met in work. She was my coworker when I changed positions and helped me so much. She came out about her story before I ever told her things weren't okay. She told the same story as me. The details were the same. The actions he did, how didnt take no for an answer. He treated me the same as he did her. And he lied saying we were the most amazing girls in the world and that he loved us. He also had confessed to me during our relationship that he one time took things way too far with one of his exes, Julie/Julia, I dont remember exactly. They had no contact afterward. I told him it wasnt rape to comfort him but how he told it it was exactly rape.

He works at my work place. That's how we met. Every time I see him I start to panic. I've hurt myself at work and home because of him. It's been 3 years since we had gotten together and 2 since I broke up with him. I'm not over it. I had to tell him that I would get the law involved should he ever approach me again. He never did except once to wish me happy thanksgiving. I wanted to die that day and tell the police but I didnt. I was scared and still am.

I have to see him every weekend at work. I try to avoid him as I know his usual schedule and routine at work but recently hes just there more and more and more and I cant do it. Hes gotten into close proximity more than once with me recently and sent me into over panic attacks that I have to either hide away to calm down or act like I dont have because I'm on the floor instead of the backroom. He talked to me once recently when I dropped something on the floor and I went to pick it up but he came and picked it up. I said thanks to be courteous as usual to not start anything and he said no problem or something but it was just too close. I spent 5, 10, I dont know how many minutes sitting in our overstock area for my department pacing and trying to calm down because i was just crying and pulling at my hair so I didnt bash my head into the wall. I dug my nails into my arms and bit my lips so hard it kept them damaged the next few days.

I have medicine to take but the dosage I was given doesnt help with these panic attacks. And I cant afford to take more than the dosage (which I have done many times already because I couldnt handle it) because it could kill me from overdosing, and it makes it hard to do my job as it causes me to almost fall asleep.

I just cant do this. I'm so scared he's gonna say something or come up to me or spread some lie about me. It's been over 2 years I dont know why I'm still so scared but just seeing him or hearing his name or seeing any neon green (that's his vest color for the job) or seeing a tall skinny dude in black pants and black hoodie from the back or someone with short blonde hair and glasses that so much resembles him

I just I want to die so bad. I hate it I hate it I hate it I hate it I cant do it it's just horrible and I cant. I want to hurt myself so bad

I just want the nightmare to be over already but it keeps getting worse",rileysmiley45,1,0,0,2020-01-11 3:29:49,rapecounseling
en53lm,Trouble trying to be social because I'm triggered by my own car of all stupid things.,1b,rant,2,"28F. I was raped repeatedly in an abusive relationship when I was 20. He would force kissing on me, force me to touch his genitals, and force his hands in my pants in semi-public areas. He followed me to my car in the school parking lot and raped me in the backseat in broad daylight. 
Since then, I feel myself dissociating when I drive and I often get high anxiety just by getting in my car to go anywhere. Being a passenger in my parents' cars doesn't bother me, though. I don't have a job right now and I feel safer staying at home most of the day. I drive to the gym with no issues, but it's less than one mile away. I dissociate and get flashbacks at random times at home, too. 
I'd like to out and visit with the friends I had before I was 20. I recreated a Facebook account this past year after deleting it in 2014 and chatted with some old friends a bit. They seemed happy I came back. The constant media talk of sexual assault/harassment issues was too much for me, so I didn't want to use any form of social media for a while. Plus, my past eating disorder was a contributing factor to my self- isolation. I don't know how to live a normal life again. This past decade has been absolute hell with the abuse, rapes, eating disorder and going to treatment, and getting diagnosed with a combination  of depression, GAD, and OCD. I don't want this to carry over any longer. I'm scared that this trauma is going to cause me to have either an anorexia or bulimia relapse. I've been finding myself working out excessively again because it numbs out my thoughts.",goldenmantella,1,0,2,2020-01-11 8:45:46,rapecounseling

encf2o,I couldn’t stop them!,1b,rant,3,"[Long post]
it all started when I [26f ] was 9 or 10. My family wasn’t the idea family. majority of my male family members were either alcoholics or drunks. Including my cousin 26m (now 43). He was always verbally sexual towards the females in the family. My family, including my mom would just laugh &amp; not make a big deal out of it, as if it was normal. My mom would leave to work &amp; he would be left to babysit. He would say things like “damn, you’re sexy &amp; when you get older I’m going to tear that lil p***y up”. at the time I was 9 or 10 so I never really saw the wrong in the things he would say especially since my family normalized it. Eventually when he would baby sit, along with the inappropriate verbal statements he begin to make self gestures. One day I remember him telling me how fat my p***y looked in some shorts while he sat there rubbing his penis inside his pants. I felt a little uncomfortable but it still never crossed my mind to tell my mom because it wasn’t something that they didn’t already knew he did. I should have spoke to someone about it but I didn’t, I don’t know why. Afrer a few more times of him babysitting things got worse. I was laying in my bed watching TV, he came inside my room &amp; closed the door. My heart was racing &amp; I couldn’t form the words to ask him why was he in my room. He started saying how much he want me &amp; how pretty I was. He got in the bed &amp; layed me on my stomach &amp; layed on top of me. I just laid there. I was terrified but I never said a word. He started grabbing &amp; rubbing on my vagina over my shorts. I started to shake &amp; cry. I felt him become more aroused as he grinned on my butt while still rubbing my vagina. after what felt like forever he stopped &amp; said “I’m going to wait until you’re older and that p***y is fatter “ . I never told. It went on until I was 12. He never penetrated me he just became more aggressive with the touching. It stopped at 12 because that’s when I was old enough to stay home alone. I didn’t need a babysitter anymore.

why didn't I tell someone ?

Now I’m 13 going on 14 &amp; I’m going to a school that’s combined with a high school. I’m friendly &amp; I enjoy the attention of males. Not in a sexual way, I just liked to be seen &amp; admired. I had a lot of male friends but I wasn’t sexual, sex wasn’t even on my mind. plus, if I would even so much of get on the phone with a male friend my mom would be furious. She would call me sluts, wh***s, you name it. She didn’t approve of me &amp; male communication in anyway. I eventually got a bf. He was 17. We would talk on the phone when my mom would leave home. he was nice... at first. besides the fact that he always wanted to talk about sex &amp; how he wanted to be my first time. It was a bit annoying &amp; so sometimes when he mentioned it I’d be like “yeah, yeah,“ sarcastically to change the subject. I didn’t think much of it. Anyways.... I knew my mom didn’t approve so to spend time with him, I invited him over after she left for work one day. We started watching a movie. He kissed my neck a lot, he then asked if he could see my room. I was excited for him to see my room, I thought he would find the colors, the bears &amp; my doll collection to be very cool. Once we got in my room he didnt really pay attention to it, just me. . . (Guess at that moment I was finally getting attention, just not the attention I craved) I was talking about my doll collection &amp; he interrupted me with kisses. I was ok with kisses. It’s not like we hadn’t kissed before. Then he started to kiss me with his tongue. we never kissed like that, so it was a little weird... but still I was ok. he pushed me on the bed &amp; continued to kiss me. I was a little nervous but still I was ok. he started to kiss faster, his breathing became more rapid, he kissed me more aggressively. I got scared! My heart started beating fast! I told him to stop &amp; I tried to get up. he ignored me &amp; pushed me back down. I continued to ask him to stop. The more I begged him to stop the more he did. While aggressively kissing me he started to grab my breast. He stuck his hands in my pants &amp; started to rub my vagina. I begged louder, I screamed, I started to cry, I started hitting him &amp; scratching him. He took his hands out my pants &amp; used his hands to pin mine down. He pulled down my pants &amp; his. I’m terrified. At this point I know he’s not gonna stop but still, I kept begging him to, I kept fighting I kept screaming. He shoves his penis inside of me. He pin my arms again but this time only using one hand &amp; using the other to hold my mouth. I felt like I wanted to die. I couldn’t scream anymore, I couldn’t move, my body got weak.... I just layed there. he finished &amp; he smiled &amp; told me how pretty I was. When he left I layed there. I was frozen. I knew my mom would be home soon so I eventually got up &amp; bathed &amp; pretended to be my normal self. I never told. I wrote about it &amp; my mom eventually read my diary &amp; found out. She blamed me &amp; we never discussEd it again.

Maybe I could’ve did more. I shouldn't have stopped fighting!

A year later I’m 15. . . I have a job at a restaurant this nice couple comes in &amp; ask if I wanted to make a few dollars babysitting they’re two kids. (They had came in several times before so technically we weren’t complete strangers) I agreed. They canceled &amp; later the wife called me &amp; ask if I could babysit at her house because she was going out of town for a job &amp; her husband had to work. I agreed. I was supposed to babysit for about 5hrs until the husband got home. the wife picked me up &amp; drop the kids &amp; I off at their home. I was to leave once the husband got home. Instead of 5hrs I was there for 1hr before the husband came. He called me to the living room from out the kids room to pay me so I could leave. I noticed he closed the kids door walking out their room. When we got to the living room. He asked me was I a virgin. I said yes because to me I was, I never consented to sex. He smiled &amp; automatically I felt uncomfortable. I told him it’s ok, the babysitting was free of charge and I tried to rush to the door to leave out. He grabbed me, put me against the wall &amp; raised my dress. he said “don’t scream or I’m going to get angry” i said no &amp; I begged him not to but I never screamed. He ignored me, he raped me on the wall next to his kids room. why didn’t I scream ??? I just stood there crying &amp; asking him to stop. I never told anyone

Why didn’t I scream!

I became a cutter, I became a pill popper, I became a gang member, I fought alot, I got into lots of trouble in school. I went to therapy... but that was for the first rape. The other things I never discussed.

Im 17 now. I just met the person I will eventually marry. I’m in love! &amp; I’m ready to have sex but I cant. I want to soooo bad but I’m terrified. The very first time attempting sex with him I had a panic attack. i told him it was because Im a virgin and just don’t know what to expect. But I wasn’t a virgin... I had been raped twice &amp; molested. I was really just scared that it would happen again. Even though I knew him &amp; loved him I felt like it was gonna keep happening. eventually, I opened up &amp; i told him about what happened to me when I was 14. just that one. I didn’t tell Him about the other times because I didn’t want him to think it was my fault since it happened over again. I didn’t want him to not want me because I was damaged. Anyways, He understood. He listened to me talk &amp; he had patience with me &amp; we made love that was beautiful.

Im now 26 years old. Husband 27. We have beautiful kids &amp; I’m not having flashbacks anymore, i have even forgotten their last names and a few details. but I’m having weird sex habits now. I just don’t understand why after all these years. I thought I was over it, I thought I was fine. Am I? Now when my husband and I are having sex I want it to be extremely rough. It have to be for me to orgasm. usually my husband isn’t allowed to hold my hands or my mouth when we’re having sex because it makes me feel like I’m being raped. But now I actually want him to hold me down, I want him to go against my no’. sometimes I’d say no &amp; I really want it just to feel like he went against my wishes. I want sex from him all the time now &amp; I want to be in control some of the times but mostly i want him to hurt me, be rough with me, dominate me. I think he is starting to worry a little. is this normal? Am I ok? I feel ok.",Perfect-Beyond,1,0,10,2020-01-11 20:04:13,rapecounseling

enjehr,Dealing with memories you’re not sure are real?,1a,help-seeking,2,"I have two memories of my time with a family friend that are of me being inappropriately touched by the family friend.  However, they are so cloudy and vague I really don’t know if they’re real.  I was later raped when I was ten and that memory is different... vivid and while I can’t remember his face or what happened before or after the incident I clearly remember the incident.  Which is why I’m questioning if the other memories are just something made up or not.  I do remember some behaviors I did before the rape and around the time of these unsure memories that seem weird or possibly not normal.  Until I was about 9 I would touch myself occasionally in public but in a less obvious way.  Almost like I know I shouldn’t.  I don’t remember why I did it other than I know it felt good and I don’t know how I figured how to do what I did.  I stopped doing it when I realized it was an embarrassing thing to do in front of people.  I still did it privately. Even though I was very much potty trained...at age 6 and 7 I had a few accidents in bed at night after waking up from nightmares.  I don’t remember the nightmares.  I would have sleep paralysis where I would see a man standing next to my bed but couldn’t move or etc...  I don’t know.  But I worry that my brain is just making stuff up and it’s not real.  I also know that some of these behaviors can also be developmentally normal although I question normal when 6/7/8/9.  I have kids of my own and they don’t do stuff like what I did at all and I have kids at various ages.  I have a therapist and we’ve talked about it briefly but I recently said I want to sort it out more.  I haven’t told him about the behaviors I mentioned etc...  it took me quite a while to feel safe telling him about my rape which I had never told anyone about as well as how I was groomed by online predators later after my rape.  So it’s difficult to talk about it still and I still have a near impossible time talking about anything related to sex out loud. I struggle to even say the word “sex” out loud without so much anxiety.  My therapist said only I can really determine if those memories are real.  I just don’t know how.  They seem so real but not real at the same time and it’s literally two 3-5 second memories.",humblyeden,1,0,0,2020-01-12 5:19:31,rapecounseling

eo1udh,Martial rape? Coercion?,1b,help-seeking,3,"After much research and reflection I can finally admit I am in a verbally and emotionally abusive relationship. In my journey I've come across some things that make me feel I may also be victim of sexual coercion, it's hard for me to use the term rape, that seems like such a strong word to describe an act I'm not sure of. Keep in mind I've only recently, in the past six nonths or so, realized I've been abused for most of my relationship (26 yrs). 

My husband gropes, grabs, and fondles me at times I feel are inappropriate. If I pull away an dart my eyes around the room he says the kids aren't paying attention or makes sure he is between me and them to block their view of him grabbing my breast, between my legs or butt. We have 2 teenage sons and a daughter. He will grab my butt in public and less often but sometimes my breast. He knows it makes me uncomfortable but his words are-you're just so hot I can't help it. I've asked for a divorce three times over the course of 5 years, (not directly due to the sexual stuff but because of how he treats me) but we are still together. I plan to leave as soon as I am financially able. The past year I have lost all interest in having a sexual relationship with him. Despite knowing this he continues to fondle me. It has also escalated to intercourse. I have not initiated sex in over a year. Though we pretty much do have it anywhere from twice a week to once every other week. The scenario is alsways the same. Three to fours days after we last had sex he starts the groping which is my indication that it's 'time'. I avoid undressing in front of him. I avoid showering when we are home alone because he will barge in the bathroom and gawk at me in the shower if the kids aren't home, which results in him sitting on the bed expectantly when I am done. If I try to get out and dress without acknowledging his desire he says, what are you doing? We didn't have sex yet. Other times he waits in the bathroom til I can't stall any longer and get out of the shower then he steers me or motions to the bed and says let's get this over with. He has even said, I know you don't want to do this so let's hurry up and do it. All these scenarios end in me silently going to the bed, and giving in to keep the peace. I know I can clearly say no but that leads to his other strategy. When I do say no or indicate I am not interested he gets grumpy, pouts, ignores me, or is an outright jerk. He can use some or all of those everytime. The severity and length of this can last days til I finally give in just to bring some peace back to the house. I finally called him out on his behaviour recently and it caused a huge argument. I told him how he acts when he doesn't get sex at least every three days. He said of course he gets grumpy and I just have to deal with it, it's his feelings and he can't help it. I told him he can feel grumpy but it doesn't give him the right to be a dick to me. He's choosing to punish me and that's manipulation. That seemed to connect. He was significantly less of a jerk the rest of the day but later that evening, while coming out of the bathroom, I found myself being steered to the bed. I was so dumbfounded but I went along with it since the kids had heard part of the argument from that morning and I didn't want to fight again and figured, well, at the least this gets me off the hook for three days. Nope, the next morning he comes to the guest room (I moved out of our room in August) gets in bed with me and starts poking me in the back with...you know. Then it happens again. I have no interest in him sexually anymore. He knows I avoid being undressed to any degree in front of him. He said if I don't have sex with him he's gonna have to get on some app and get it that way if I don't do it with him. (Not that it would bother me, I wish he would, then maybe he'd stop making me have sex or punishing me when I don't.) He has said on more than one occasion, I know you don't want to do this so let's get it over with. I typically just lay there and wait for it to be over. I don't even touch him. 

My questions are, am I being raped? Coerced? Is the fact that he says I know you don't want to, so let's get it over with his admission he knows he doesn't have consent? It physically makes me nauseous to think I've been repeatedly raped for almost a year now. How did I let this happen?",robinsparkles506,1,0,7,2020-01-13 9:18:53,rapecounseling
eod26m,*TW* Boyfriend (24M) Began to Have Sex with Me (21F) While I was Asleep,1b,rant,2,"Any rude comments will be reported. I already feel uncomfortable posting this. But I feel the need to get it off of my chest. To preface  this post; I am a 21 year old female, sexual assault victim, and have been dating my 23 year old boyfriend for about 1 year and 6 months. 

I was raped in 2016. I'm still somewhat in denial about it, and am still processing what happened to me that night. So, with that said here we go. In the beginning of the relationship, my boyfriend asked if he should ""eat me out"" or ""fuck me"" while I'm asleep. For some reason, I agreed to it. He would always say ""I don't want to try it. I always feel weird about it. He did a few nights ago.

I had eaten an edible, and was passed the FUCK out. It was in the middle of the night when he asked me, ""Do you want to have sex?"" I was so tired, that I could only say ""No"" and passed out again seconds later. I woke up to him attempting to eat me out. I woke up briefly, still definitely not into having sex. I didn't stop him because I was too sleepy. 

After a while, I gave in. In the moment, it felt wrong. In the morning, I blocked it out of my mind. I didn't think about it until today, and my stomach flipped. It still felt wrong. It made me sad. It was a miscommunication error between the both of us. It's an odd situation. I don't even know what to think. I don't know why, or how, I could have been into him ""fucking me"" awake. I never realized how much my assault affected me.",justasadunicorn,1,0,5,2020-01-14 0:18:35,rapecounseling
eokyyz,How to tell my parents I was raped a year and a half ago,1a,help-seeking,2,"Hi everyone. I (17f) was raped when I was 15 by a guy I went on a date with and then was in a very toxic, abusive situation with. For over a year I didn't let myself think about what happened, nor even consider that what happened to me was nonconsensual; I kinda locked it down in a box I was never allowed to open. I effectively gaslighted myself to believe it wasn't rape. I told myself it was consensual so many times I struggled to remember what exactly happened until almost a year later, the first time I slept with a guy again while quite drunk. It all came back to me while doing it and I threw up after doing something specific, not because of the alcohol but because I went into flashback mode. Still, although my ex told me what happened was rape, I blamed myself for not screaming or physically fighting back more - it was only a week ago I actually accepted and believed it was rape. I said I didn't want to at the start, I kept saying I didn't want to, and my pelvic floor completely shut down when he tried, but he just kept going. I finally know that was rape.

Now that I finally have accepted it, I'm looking at how to move forward. I have told my boyfriend, who has been absolutely amazing and doesn't expect me to do anything I don't want to do, and I told my therapist this morning. However, I feel like I really need to tell my parents what happened as I think it is feeding into my anorexia and anxiety. Do any of you have any tips on how to have this conversation and how to deal with their reaction? I'm worried they'll be upset I didn't tell them sooner, or start crying because they're so sad, or want to go to the police immediately (which I don't think I want to do), and I don't know how I'll look them in the eye after I tell them because I'm so ashamed. Any advice would be much appreciated.",theonetruebicon,1,0,6,2020-01-14 13:01:39,rapecounseling

I don’t check my doors constantly to see if they’re locked. I know they are. 
I’ve driven through where he works in passing and not even realised. Not frozen up and struggled to hide my fear like I have before. 

Yes I changed my number and my phone to escape some of the memories. Yes I hide sometimes. Yes I am still in therapy. But I’ve gotten some much better when I never thought I would. 

I opened my Uber history recently and saw the Uber drive from that night. And instead of feeling dread and panic and dirty. I felt sad but calm and determined. I was broken that night. Some parts of me are still forever missing. But I love and respect who I’ve become and continue to become.  And I look back at that girl and don’t blame her. I just wish I could tell her some things to prevent the incident. 

But I can’t. What I can do is make sure I continue to show defiance and continue to thrive. 

When all this happened the thought of celebrating my birthday or the new year seemed so hollow. Next weekend all I’m going to do is celebrate.  I’ve done nothing but laugh for weeks. 

I’ve got a long way to go but I never ever thought I’d make it this far.

I was assaulted beginning of December. It was by one of my friends with benefits when we were sleeping next to eachother. It happened between the hours of 3 and 4 am. Two weeks after it happened, right around christmas, I noticed I kept waking up at 3am. Exactly at 3am. Sometimes I would have verge of anxiety attacks. Sometimes my eyes would just open and I'd be wide awake. One of the guy friends that I told has slept next to me sometimes has mentioned it saying how he can feel my body tense up when it gets closer to 3am. The only time when I havent woken up at 3am and fell asleep early was when he held me. Otherwise I have woken up almost at 3am on the dot every single time. 

My solution has been to stay up until 3am so I dont have anxiety attacks and I dont think about what happens. This has worked over christmas break as I havent had school. Now that I have school, I'm really losing sleep and i just want to fucking sleep. I'm done letting the guy win because all I can think about is him peacefully sleeping like he did right after anally raping me. 

I just want to hear from others how you cope from something like this so I can try it out and maybe sleep for once. Thank you.",zao15,1,0,3,2020-01-15 7:26:56,rapecounseling
ep3h2h,I think being possibly assaulted as a teen has lead me to develop unhealthy patterns.,1b,rant,2,"I was 16 and my boyfriend and I had taken a break. I wasn’t sure what I wanted and we were fighting a lot. My mental health was never good as I grew up in a home with an alcoholic parent, lots of fighting, and a brother who was on his way to trouble. My brother was about 22-23 when I was 16 and he had been dating my best friend. They had just broken up. I was never okay with them dating and everyone knew it wasn’t right but let it go. 

Anyway this summer is when I started to really drink a lot. My brother was well into his alcoholism and hanging out with a bad crowd. He’d encourage my friends and I to drink and supply us with the liquor. And he had a friend, also 22-23 who was now living in my home. The first time something happened, I was incredibly drunk. The friend kept flirting and I remember thinking I must have been so cool since he was older. I remember I went to walk away though, and he sort of grabbed me and started aggressively kissing me. So I did it back. I remember feeling a little frozen by it but figured it was normal. 

I would drink a lot this summer with my friends and brother and his friend and this happened a few more times. Then one night I caught my brother having sex with another one of my friends- again totally messed up and she was so drunk too. I remember crying and my brothers friend tried comforting me. Eventually he started pulling my hand to his penis and wanting me to get him off. I’d do it and stop and he would force it back. He was holding me there pretty hard and I just went along with it. I still feel really violated by it to this day. I know I played a roll, but I feel like it just wasn’t a good environment for someone my age. 

Eventually I got back with my boyfriend and stopped drinking so often. Then when I turned 21 I began drinking again. Whenever I would drink I would black out. 

I went to a party and got so drunk. I remember being on the couch and trying to sleep and a guy from high school was there. I was crying and rambling and I don’t remember much else except waking up the next morning to him gone. When I asked what happened he said we kissed a little and then he left cuz I was asleep.  I told my boyfriend when I processed it and we moved on. 

But I’ve gotten into other bad situations with guys while being blackout drunk. It’s never gone as far but I’ve put myself in positions that aren’t appropriate and could be dangerous. I’ll find out the next day that I was stumbling around, falling, making no sense. Leaning or laying on everyone. 

I’ve always been honest with my boyfriend and things had been fine for years when I stopped drinking. Ultimately we have decided that my drinking is really the issue here and I need to stop because it’s a problem. I don’t drink often, 3-4 times a month at most, sometimes not for months though. But when I do it’s always too far. 

I guess I’m wondering if my experiences when I was younger have affected how I act now around men when I’m that drunk or if I’m just an easy target because I get that drunk. 

When I’m sober, every single experience I’ve had makes me feel sick and disgusted and ashamed. It’s things I would never do sober. I know I’ve cheated and betrayed my boyfriend, and I’m not taking away from that, but I’m just wondering if I was truly assaulted at 16 and how that may be affecting my actions now. 

Sorry for the ramble, I’m just going through it right now and not doing great.",vitalogy95,1,0,0,2020-01-15 15:10:10,rapecounseling
ep9hfu,Can being assaulted at a younger age alter sexual behaviors?,1b,help-seeking,2,"I believe I was like sexually assaulted when I was about 16 but my brothers friend who was 22 or 23 at the time. I was super drunk - because they were letting me and my friends drink and encouraging it as well. He would constantly compliment me and one day he grabbed and aggressively kissed me. I kind of froze but didn’t think much of it. Then one night I was super drunk and upset about something that I’d rather not go into a lot of detail about, and he tried comforting me. Before I know if he was forcing my hand on his parts and if I tried stopping he would force it back. If I tried to get up and go to bed he would hold me down and kiss me harder. When I woke up I had horrible hickeys and bruises on my lips because of his aggression. I have felt weird about it ever since but chalked it up to me being stupid and drunk until recently when I processed it. 

Since then, I’ve behaved inappropriately while drunk and have had issues with moderating my drinking. I’ve been in other blackouts where I either have no or little memory of what happened. One where the guy was kissing me and I was crying and barely awake. I didn’t fully know he kissed me until the next day. 

Another where a guy was encouraging me to drink more when I was already drunk. I went to bed and he followed. I don’t remember much except making sure he didn’t touch me and him forcing my mouth onto his penis. I complied eventually but if I tried to stop he would hold me down. Both of these last incidences happened while I was in a relationship. I know they’re my fault but fortunately my boyfriend forgave me and it’s been many years. However, I’ve recently realIzed my drinking is an issue as I often blackout- despite not drinking frequently, I don’t have a limit when I do and I get myself in unsafe positions. 

I’m just curious if my initial experience as a teen could have less to this. I’m not a sexual person sober, I’m actually rather conservative, and never used to be a sexual person when I’d drink. I feel like something is seriously wrong and maybe it’s as simple as me being a bar person.",vitalogy95,1,0,7,2020-01-15 22:18:19,rapecounseling

We were drunk and on molly. He was even more fucked up, molly, alcohol, shrooms, weed (which I learn after apparently makes him dissociate).

He leaves but doesn’t shut the door. I go to wash my hands, he pulls me out of the bathroom and starts trying to kiss me. I pull away I kept trying to walk to out the bedroom door, he pushed me back every time. He pulls my dress up I push it down several times. I say no. I call his gfs name several times because I know she’s right outside. Nothing was working. So I gave in, I kissed back, I fucked back. I let it happen even though I know it was the wrong thing to do.

eqbiyg,Just logged into my Facebook account for the first time in five years and the person who raped/groomed me for two years as a child.has been trying to get in touch with me.,1b,help-seeking,2,"I got an email message today from Facebook about my account, I honestly had forgotten that i still had an active Facebook account as it's been years since I last used it. When I logged in to permanently delete the account I was surprised to see multiple messages from the person who spent two years grooming and eventually raping me when I was in first to third grade. 

He's the reason I went from being outside riding my bike daily to staying inside and saying video games, he's the reason I decided to get fat, he's one of the reasons that to this day I've never had a healthy long term relationship. 

It was safer for me not to go outside because if I was outside and he was as well I'd end up with a dick in my mouth.

I was terrified of being drafted. I'm male and the way I was groomed was we 'played army' where I had to drink his pee so the ""enemy"" wouldn't find our tracks. Sometimes it was actually pee, sometimes I had to 'suck the pee out' granted at the time I didn't really understand the difference, but hated the latter because it always took longer. But I vividly remember the day finding out that if you're to fat you couldn't join the army, I had found my way out. I can picture the exact moment as clear as day, standing in the elementary school breezeway on the way out to recess, when I decided that I HAD to become fat.

While it's not the sole reason thanks to a relatively fucked up childhood, I have major trust/relationship issues, where I have literally moved out of state rather than have conversations with people.

And to my eternal shame he's the reason that I convinced myself that in order to keep friends in highschool I'd have to be willing to preform the same services for them. For fucks sake there was one night that I let four guys run a train on me because they needed someone to bottom.

Now he wants to talk. I'm not going to talk to him, I can't. But now I'm thinking, if I did, what would I say? Would he ask for forgiveness? Does he even want to talk about it? Does he even remember?

I'm cried out, I think I'm past the thought that a knife would be faster than slowly eating myself to an early grave, wishing desperately for a hug, but at the same time utterly repulsed by the idea of being with someone.

My (F28) partner (M26) has been incredibly patient, supportive and understanding. I've just had a bit of a PTSD come back. It's made it difficult for our sex life. Sometimes the thought of it makes me a bit sick, but sometimes I really want to try, but then I end up with waves of nasty images from the several times I've been assaulted / abused. I absolutely don't want to associate him to these thoughts, he is nothing like the people who did those things to me. 

I'm worried that I'll make him feel like shit if we do have to stop because of anxiety attack or flashbacks.

I'm looking for tips, for example I was thinking maintaining eye contact might help? Anything to keep me grounded in the moment and reassure my body and mind that I am indeed completely safe with him. 
All suggestions welcome.

To confirm, my partner is amazing, has been happy with me sharing as much or as little as I feel comfortable. He's respected my boundaries and is never pushing for it, these last few weeks he's basically not initiated and we've got a clear understanding that I'm in control of what we do and when.

Recently, I ended a relationship with someone who absolutely adored me. We were dating for almost a year and, to keep it real, he is the most amazing person ever.

Honestly, I think my PTSD has fucked up my brain. I have never been in a relationship where I was actually treated well. I have been sexually assaulted or abused by every man I was ever in love with. I feel like my brain now associates the feeling of romantic love with sexual assault/toxic relationships? I genuinely think my brain doesn't understand how to be in a healthy relationship. I love my ex but it's like something is blocking me from *really* feeling that love. It's so hard to explain. All I know is that I repeatedly find myself being attracted to men who treat me like shit. And I feel so fucked up for breaking up with a man who wanted to give me everything. Who treated me like an absolute angel.  I was wondering if anyone has anything to share about this.

eqt7w0,"Anyone knowledgeable of the physical effects of rape while unconscious-Advice wanted please! At 18, still don't know if it happened to me",1b,help-seeking,3,"Okay, I appreciate anyone reading this, I've thought of posting for so long-- certain MeToo articles struck me, ESP where they talk about preventing the person from hurting others, so it's been nagging at me. 

Also because I was reading a book that made me think back to when I was 18. A part in ""Come as you are"" where she describes nonconcordance and an instance of someone raping an unconscious drunk girl, the way she describes it, as the girl being completely unconscious and that being able to happen without jarring her awake, struck me. I used to think something that violent would wake one up.

 So please, any insight is very appreciated, and do you think yes or no? Am I stupid for ignoring a 1 time anomaly of bright red non-period blood from my own body, or am I silly for thinking this happened when I felt nothing- not even soreness. 
Here is the very detailed account:

I've always been uncertain whether I was assaulted, or not, when I was 18. There is evidence for both, and it was so insane, the thought that *I* could be a 'victim' and I literally didn’t have room to process it, and didn’t even have insurance or a doctor anyway, didn’t know what to do with it, so I ignored it and tried to block it out of my mind when I couldn't figure it out. And after the incident, I made strong mental notes, and sort of made a mental note to later figure it out when able to process it. I made sure to remember as many details as I could, and talked to a few friends about it and a counselor at college once.  I've never talked about rape with anyone before and know nothing of the specifics of it, of the physicality, I may have a bad understanding of it. I can’t shorten this as it’s too hard to separate this in my mind from the social context of it.

 If a professional, like someone who has done medical exams on victims, or knows what is typical to a victim of this, familiar with the specifics of rape and being unconscious during it, thought that I *was* assaulted, I would want to take some kind of action. Because that would mean this man could do it to other people, and i absolutely don’t want that! But I don’t know how that even works, I looked him up and he lives in Wisconsin now, and I’ve moved to Washington, though it happened when we both lived in Maryland. So where would a case even be? Anyway... so this is what happened. I was always a girl that was friends with mostly guys, used to being around my big brother and his friends and more comfortable with boys, bullied a lot by girls. So anyway I was hanging out one night at a new person I'd just met's house, Sam, in Maryland. 


The 'mallrat' kids, my good friend Andy, and my neighbor/friend James were definitely there. There was a certain group of kids always hanging out at this time, beyond those 2 it may have been also his friend David M, David Z, or Brian, possibly others too. Andy introduced me to this guy named Sam, so I now realize I sort of subconsciously conferred the same trust and comfort onto this new person Sam as I had with Andy, as he was sort of vouching for him that this was a good guy that he'd met. They were all talking about how he had a Guinness Record for piercings, I didn’t know if that was true but he did have a LOT, they also said somewhere in his private area had a piercing, and that made me gag to myself, I hate piercings, especially on a weird looking guy like this, but I shrugged and laughed along with them, pretending his piercings did not skeeve me out. So at this Sam guy's house, I felt pretty comfortable as all the usual people we knew were there with us. This would be the 1 standout night in my life where I drank the most I've ever drank. I remember Sam deciding to do a drinking game, I hadn't really done that much, but it was whenever a certain thing happened in the movie Predator you had to drink. I would do little sips as I hate the taste of liquor and I remember him saying ""come onnn! real drinks!"" and sometimes I'd try to skip my turn hoping they wouldn't notice and Sam kept egging me on and pressuring me, going 'come on you have to follow the RULES!'.. and I would dutifully nod and go ""yeah, ok ok, it IS the rule!"" So I'd never ever been so pressured before while drinking, and at the time I thought he was just being silly, and wanted *everyone* to be extra drunk just to be really honest and funny as possible that night, and again, I felt really safe with Andy and the other guys I knew there. 


So I did not realize how drunk I was getting with his constant needling me, and I can't remember the conversation around when the other guys left. Since this was pre-Uber, it may have been hard to get them to take me home on their way, it may have been super far from their houses, or I may have already been very sick by then, and needed to just throw up and lay there a bit, thinking I'd wait til it wore off and I could safely drive home. Alcohol's effects generally would wear off with me in a couple hours, especially since I rarely drank more than a couple drinks. At some point, the others unfortunately left and I was alone with Sam, though his mother was in the house in a back bedroom, that also gave me an added feeling of safety. ""Oh, his MOM is here, what could go wrong, there's a MOM!"" --My thoughts. At some point I started having to throw up for the 1st time from drinking, and Sam gave me a bucket and held my hair back, that also told me he was kind, helping me similar to when my dad would hold my hair back when I was sick at home. I thought 'what a good guy!' Sam also was throwing up, less than me. So I thought, okay well he's busy being sick too. I tried to wait til I felt better, but at some point blacked out and was unconscious on his couch. 
This is actually the 1st time I'd fallen asleep at a friends house... I wear contacts and I also had always insisted on going home &amp; taking them out, when other friends would fall asleep on each others couches, I'd always tiptoe out the door to go home to my own bed. Andy and others sort of knew this, and a few times on other occasions, would see me tiptoing out the door so I wouldn't wake them. So this stood out a lot in my mind.   


The next thing I remember waking up on that same couch, and I looked around, realizing Sam wasn't asleep, he was typing away on his computer in the same room. I felt a little uneasy, realizing I had been asleep very deep, normally I sleep very shallow and wake very easily. But this felt pretty deep, like there was no way I could've avoided it, and I had zero experience with getting 'black out drunk' so I assumed that was why I was out like that, I assumed it came with the throwing up territory. I remember being slightly worried, and mentally reminding myself that his mom was in a nearby room to comfort myself that nothing weird could've happened. I asked Sam what happened and he just said something like 'you got really sick and threw up a lot'. I looked down at my belt, and I cannot remember the exact outfit I was wearing, I only remember that I made a sharp mental note that the closure for these jeans I had on was somewhat complicated, and I had on something also, that was tied in a way that to me seemed like it'd be very difficult for this caveman of a guy to re-do and make look like the perfect way I did it-- if something could've happened. I also took note that I felt physically nothing down there, and I was thinking that if anything HAD happened, I would have felt sore, or it'd hurt in some way. That seemed like another proof that nothing happened, though I wasn't sure, of course, I've never talked to anyone who'd been assaulted let alone much about regular, consensual sex. 


I felt crappy, but I walked out and drove home in the early hours, somewhere around maybe 3 or 4am. I got home, brushed my teeth and got ready for bed, and went to pee. I pulled my pants down and froze, a chill running up my spine, when I saw a little fresh bright red blood soaked into my underwear. My thoughts raced and went back to the night at Sam's house, as I so badly wished I'd never gone there at all, wishing I'd just spent a boring night at home. I remember reasoning it out that, normally my period blood would start with somewhat oxidized brownish blood that was thick, and eventually, never on the 1st day of it, it would sometimes be like regular blood color, but still more viscous, like jelly-- and this blood I saw looked like regular type of thinner blood like you'd get with a cut. The only thing was, I didn't FEEL like anything was cut, I kept thinking over and over how I didn't feel sore, bad, ANYTHING, down there and so I didn't know how to reconcile these different conflicting things. I’d separated from the 1 boyfriend and partner I’d ever had the previous summer ‘03, and I only had sex a few times ever with him, but I remember it always being a bit sore the day after we did as I wasn’t used to it, so I felt like being forced would have caused something at *least* equal to that. 

I took a mirror to the outside to see if my crotch looked different than usual-- disturbed in any way, to indicate something bad happened, and it just seemed like nothing, like after I'd been asleep. So the blood part, is the main thing that spooked me very much and I made a note to tell someone about it later. Maybe, when I had to guts, to even *discuss* out loud, the viscosity of my menstrual blood (ugh!) the way I can analyze it to myself, in my head.  
So I only saw the blood in my underwear, none was actively coming from my vag at all. 


MAJOR POINT-- I had NEVER in my life, had it randomly bleed at any point when it was not my period, and my period did not start that day either. Nor has it bled for no reason since, my periods are exactly on time. I remember thinking about how they said Sam had piercings down below, I didn't know if that could've had anything to do with this blood or not, the thought was so vomit-inducing I could barely think about it.
So I was very unsettled, but went to sleep. When I woke up I remember talking to my gay best friend Christian, getting advice as I'd never been sick after drinking and he had, and he advised me to order pizza to 'soak up the alcohol', and hinting at all this in my Livejournal.


 I can't remember if it was later that day, or the next day, but I went to meet up with Andy and some of those other guys at night, at the Lake shopping area in our town, where everyone would often meet up. I remember distinctly walking up to where the guys were chattering, not knowing they were talking about me, and Andy had a very angry, hurt look on his face. 
I didn't know why, so I walked over to him and asked what was wrong, as we were walking and talking, he said several things that shocked and disturbed me. He said something like 'SO.. I heard from Sam that he had sex with you last night!' I remember my jaw dropping in complete horror, as I added this to the mental list in my head. ""WHAT?! What are you talking about?!! After you left I got sick, threw up, then FELL ASLEEP.. why would you say we had SEX?!? I WAS ASLEEP! Don't you get that if he HAD done that it would've been.. ra--..."" I couldn’t even say that awful word. And I was shaking, so horrified and scared, but he didn't realize that, because he was very caught up in his own head and anger, such that he couldn't notice my shock. I interrogated him and asked why would he say that, and he said Sam (possibly when I saw him typing across the living room as I woke up on the couch) had IMed him and bragged to him that he'd ""got Lauren drunk and had sex with her"". I wasn't aware at the time, but all these guys had been teasing Andy that he liked me, but I wasn't interested in him in that way because I just wanted to be friends with him. So they cruelly teased him about being 'friend zoned', though at the time this was only hinted at in my presence, and I was ignorant of that, mean as it is. Or, I didn’t want to acknowledge that in my mind, and risk ending a friendship that really meant a lot to me, as I really enjoyed talking to and hanging out with Andy.


Sam mocked him and tried to make Andy feel bad by saying this. He-- 10 yrs later, explained this in a Facebook message when I asked him about this. And I... well I truly had no idea what to do with all this nastiness and uncertainty, I didn't want it to be true, and I thought about how if I knew someone who'd been raped, I would sort of always think of that, when I thought of them, and I didn't want to be known that way, or associated with it. I was scared, sick to my stomach, embarrassed, hurt that Andy wasn't believing me and that he thought I would ever purposely do anything sexual with this repulsive Sam person, let alone lie about it by saying I was fucking ASSAULTED instead! That is insane. This isn't super relevant, but Andy also didn't realize I had firm rules in my head about sex, that I didn't care about kissing, but for sex, I absolutely would have to be in a trusting, safe relationship.


When I questioned Sam later, he played it off like he was just messing with Andy's head and casually joking around. I angrily told him how sick it is to say that about me when I was unconscious and ALONE at his freaking house, and he said sorry. I still talked to him on AIM and was nice to him, hoping to get more insight later on also, but I was so confused I didn't know how to handle it. I regret continuing to talk to him. I at some point came across Sam's Livejournal by accident, and it had very disturbing things in it, including talking about his attempt to hang himself. I can't remember other specifics but it just had violent writings that I was freaked out by, and I mentally noted it as showing me that he was really mentally messed up, and definitely a person who was capable of doing something crazy or bad. But I felt way too bad not knowing 100% FOR CERTAIN that he did this, so I could not say such. And so I just blocked it out, until all the MeToo stuff, and looking him up on Facebook in photos of him hugging little girls-- his sister's kids, and thinking that he could possibly do bad things to OTHER people than just me. That thought scares me, along with the thought of getting this wrong.

Looking back at this also lets me know how closed off and painfully shy I've always been, to my extreme detriment. I rarely talked about sex in general, at ALL, with ANYONE, maybe a tiny bit with my best friend, and I was extremely embarrassed by my body, and didn't even discuss my period with my own mom, ever. Let alone some creep possibly affecting it. I’m from a very closed off family that didn’t discuss this stuff and I ended up hiding my period and being ashamed by it. It seems crazy, when one doesn't even discuss *normal, healthy* sex in any context... to jump from nothing-- straight to embarrassing, horrifying, being victimized, forced sex. I STILL DO NOT KNOW.

If this matters... 8 years later, I messaged him on FB to just see what he'd say about this, while still blaming myself then for even being at his stupid house, so straight from the horse's mouth.. this was his response -- 

"" Sorry if my response is brief, im sending this from my phone and since I just saw this message didn't want to delay your piece of mind.  I can tell you unequivocally that absolutely nothing happened that night between us short of me holding you up while you puked for several hours.  My messages to Andy were certainly in poor taste but at the time were just meant to fuck with him because young asshole me found his incredible crush on you amusing and an easy source of entertainment.  I wish you had told me early this was such a point of contrition for you, I guess I assumed you knew nothing had happened as we remained in contact for some time after that and I don't recall this ever coming up again.  In short I used to be a huge asshole but taking advantage of a drunk girl was not anything I  would have done.  And I hope this has helped.""",kangarooace,1,0,0,2020-01-19 7:12:59,rapecounseling

I called him last night for a pretext (which is a recorded call at the police station) and we talked and I feel like I'm going to ruin his life. I'm still conflicted as to whether to continue with the process and eventually take it up to trial because the police (who are male) keep heavily emphasising the punishment for him which is watch house for a couple of months then jail. I have been dissasociating from the present and not coping well. It will take 2 years of my life where I will be ripped apart by the barrister and the jury and I feel like I will be eaten alive.

We had a hotel for the night and I was almost black out. I was able to get in the shower for a few minutes, I sat down on the floor and he came in and started having sex with me. I couldn’t say or do anything and he ended up raping me anally. I couldn’t say or do anything and he did this not only in the shower but later in the night after I had fallen asleep and I remember bits and pieces of that part because I was hardly conscious. I’m talking to a different guy now and we were drinking last night and we talked about having sex while drunk beforehand so it was all consensual and he asked before starting if it was okay again. He’s really into anal and I told him he could try while we were drunk (told him when I was sober) I told him though to watch out for me freezing up or getting non communicative and I ended up having a really bad flash back when he tried and he stopped immediately and comforted me. The point I’m trying to get at though is that I feel horrible that I can’t please and have fun with my current partner because of something that happened to me in the past. He says it’s okay and it’s not my fault and he is completely and totally supportive but I don’t know I just feel... ruined I guess.",Cigarettesaftersex99,1,0,1,2020-01-19 22:28:01,rapecounseling

I screamed and begged him to stop, I was in so much pain the days after and got admitted to a psych ward.

er4s4p,Just need to rant.,1a,rant,2,"Not meaning to disrespect anyone, I’m just upset right now and probably not thinking logically but these are my thoughts towards myself and myself only. I’d never blame anyone else’s incident on them, I’d only ever blame myself. I just have nobody to rant to and probably sound incredibly stupid. 


I genuinely can’t explain how much I hate that part of me. The part they used and took away from me. It feels disgusting, I feel unclean and used and just wanna rip all the skin off from there. I want my body back but I can’t have it back, it hurts. The sad thing is it’s all my fault and I’m just playing the victim. I shouldn’t have slept around in the first house, what’d I expect? Expected everyone to be okay with what I want? If that’s what I expected I was a fool but I honestly don’t remember what I expected to come out of what I did. Also the fact I show femininity, The clothes I wear are tight, I wear make up, and I always have my hair curled and the first thing people probably think of when they look at me is “She’s a girl, she has a v*” which is probably why it’s happened so many times. Because I don’t hide my sex or my gender. I don’t wanna be a female, I know it happens to males, but maybe things would be different if I was a male. I feel like I shouldn’t show my gender or my body, I feel like that’s me asking for it. The way I see it in my head is since it’s obvious I’m female, people can tell what body parts I have just by looking at me so that’s me saying “Hey get in me I have the body you’re looking for.” I have this body, it’s my responsibility, yet I show myself. I’m ashamed to have been born this way. If I didn’t have a body none of this would’ve happened. They wouldn’t have had anything to get into. Why am I a human? I can’t change my identity when I want to and it’s scary because everything I got was as a girl and that hurts + my body got destroyed and used. If I didn’t have this body it would be different. Why was I born as this? Everything leads back to me. The body that I have, the way I present myself. If I didn’t act like a girl or boy maybe they wouldn’t have wanted me. I’m just a girl who’s a show off and shows I’m a female to help my confidence when I shouldn’t because it means everyone’s just gonna take over me. It’s so embarrassing because I don’t want people to think of my body when they see me. That’s so embarrassing and awkward because of what’s been done to me like I don’t want that there, I don’t wanna admit I have that or have anyone see it because it should be mine and whoever I decide to share that to it’s on my fucking body. But nobody should’ve stolen that away from me even though it’s my fault for making it obvious I’m a stupid fucking female and have a vagina in the first place. I want me back but I shouldn’t because I gave me to them. I’m used, I’m dirty, I’m unclean, I’m disgusting, I’m nothing but a slut who deserves this. Admitting all of this is so embarrassing because I feel like I’m the only one out there like this. I don’t know if I deserve this guilt, I don’t know what’s right anymore.


All of this yet here I am in pain that won’t stop, playing the victim. Deep down I know I’m not the victim, I didn’t ask for this. I didn’t want it. I didn’t say “yes”. Nobody’s sex gives anyone a reason to hurt people no matter how they present themselves. Everyone has a body, everyone has a gender/sex, but I still feel like this.

erfs1i,Confused &amp; stuck in a rut,1a,help-seeking,2,"It’s probably bad of me to say maybe he was just giving me what I wanted. It’s confusing because I stayed. I shouldn’t have. But I did it anyway. I made a lot of bad choices. And I didn’t really understand something bad had happened until I talked about it aloud. I’m embarrassed and ashamed. I don’t want friends or family to know. I feel incredibly naive and gullible. I never thought it would happen to me because I’ve been told so many times the right way to go about things. Yet last night I forgot about everything. 

It’s challenging because I wasn’t completely opposed to having fun. But I did set boundaries that were broken multiple times. It’s left me feeling like I’m not worth listening to. This isn’t the first time I’ve had someone do something to me despite me saying no. But it’s never been to this degree. I should have kept myself safe. 

I thought it’d be easy to move forward. Like it didn’t matter. But this physical pain that’s lingering is making it hard to forget the night. I wish I didn’t tell anyone what happened. At the same time I probably would’ve kept thinking it was just a normal night of fun. 

This wasn’t supposed to be a big deal. I’m not feeling too much sadness. I am a little scared I won’t be able to find a partner that actually cares about me. Because I’ve come across way too many people that want to use me instead. Tell me lies so they can get what they want. Convince me things are okay. That it’s what I want.

I must have. Maybe they’re all right. It’s not like my body wasn’t reacting positively. But my mind knew I wasn’t ready to take that next step last night and that it was unsafe. It was my only boundary. And I tried other things but it was never enough. 

Other than feeling like I’m not worthy, this experience has left me feeling like I don’t know how to take care of myself. I let it happen. More than once. I should have never put myself in this position in the first place. If I can’t protect myself from this, how can I do anything else right? 

Now it’s quiet and gloomy in my world. I want to know everything will be okay again. I’ll be motivated and get back to a normal routine. I’ll be able to find a partner that treats me right. How do I get to that point? Because right now all I wanna do is sleep + I don’t feel like eating. I don’t want to watch a show or do work. I just wanna feel safe and loved again. But if I tell my friends and family they will be disappointed and upset. 

If you’re reading this and have gone through a similar confusing experience + successfully moved forward, pls give me your tips. How to feel normal again. This bad experience has too much power over me right now. I know this yet I can’t stop it from happening.",collegestudent3565,1,0,0,2020-01-20 16:49:37,rapecounseling

eri0y4,Should I break up with my boyfriend?,1b,help-seeking,2,"Starting note: My boyfriend didn't rape me. It was someone else. My boyfriend knows what happened.

TL;DR at bottom 

My boyfriend reminds me of the guy that molested me over a period of time.

It just feels so, so familiar. Most of the things he about sex are uncanny. He's said things that are word for word what my molestor said to me. 

Up to this point, he's outright asked for my consent to do everything. The only thing he's done without my consent is put his hand in my pants. And it's starting to take an actual mental toll on me. 

He didn't even try to do anything. He just put his hand there. I would recoil whenever he tried doing it, and he said he wanted to ""push the boundaries a little."" and I just fucking went with it. Just like I did with my molestor. And that's how I ended up getting fucking raped. 

I vomited when I saw a text notification from my boyfriend this morning. I blocked his number. I did this with my rapist.

I am so, deeply afraid that my boyfriend has been manipulating me this entire time. 

I opened up to him about being raped two days into the relationship. I started laughing and making jokes about it. He said it wasn't funny. He was understanding and took it seriously unlike so many people in my life. He seemed genuinely concerned for me, told me to go to therapy, and to talk to him whenever I needed to. 

TW: Self Harm 

My rapist also pretended to care about my problems. My rapist would constantly roll up my sleeve to check my arms for cuts. My boyfriend does the same.

TW Over 

My boyfriend's shared his hobbies and thoughts with me. He's told me about things that nobody else knows about him. He has been vulnerable around me. He spends time with me that is non-sexual. It doesn't matter whether he trusts me or not. I don't know if I can trust him. 

What if it's all just another tactic? To build up a false sense of trust before he ""pushes boundaries a little."" I don't want to be naive again. I can't let that shit happen again.

Right. so. Hi.

About a year ago, my girlfriend and I got high together and went and made food. first, and this isn't the only time this kind of a thing has happened, she pushed me against a wall and hit me (she's both taller and wider than I am). I brushed it off. We then. proceeded to the bedroom. I started panicking (sometimes sex still triggers me because of what happened when I was a kid) and told her to stop, she didn't listen. she flipped me over, pushed me down and kept going, I kept crying and pleading with her to stop but she didn't listen. I don't know if there was intent or anything, but it seemed that she was just so high that she couldn't process what was going on around her (maybe). Now here's the thing; she had totally forgotten about that night until two days ago. After the incident, I assumed she didn't mention it because she felt guilty or thought I couldn't remember it, but over time I realised that she had no idea it had happened. Two nights ago I talked to her about it and she started crying and I ended up comforting her (?). I feel so disgusting, embarrassed, lost, alone, and violated. I have no one to talk to about this because I go to her with stuff and the only other friend I have is her best friend. I feel so isolated and lost and hurt. what do I do? do I break up with her? and if I tell my psychologist, will she have to break confidentiality because she might be concerned that I'm at risk?

erpp6c,"never really recovered, feeling lost",1b,help-seeking,3,"throwaway because my actual u/ is recognizable. I also apologize in advance that I’m going to explain a lot and it’s going to be really long, but this will be the first time I’ve ever told the entire story to someone, and I just need to do it. 

In April 2018, I was at a university event with a ton of people that I knew and that knew me very well. I had just broken up with my boyfriend of almost a year, but we were still figuring out what breaking up looked like, because I was his first girlfriend, and it was generally a weird time. Anyway, so at this event, there was a guy who was 4(ish) years older than me who I didn’t know. He took an interest in me and it was sweet at first, as I had not really been hit on for over a year since being in the relationship. It very quickly became very uncomfortable. In pretty much every photo from that event, it looks normal, but I know that his hand was up my dress behind the scenes. He tried to kiss me against a wall at one point during the night but I pushed him off and ignored his advances for the first of the night. 

Later on that night, my roommate who was also at the event and I invited a group of our friends back to our house to drink and wind down the night closer to home. I didn’t know until we were already at my house that someone that my roommate had invited had driven the guy to and from the event, and so he showed up at my house. He was one of my roommates friends, which I also didn’t know until this point. I didn’t want to be rude and cause a scene, so I didn’t say anything. I made a point to sit in our armchair, so he couldn’t sit next to me, and also positioned the chair on the complete opposite side of the room, with the large, circular coffee table between us (this is important). Cut a long story slightly shorter, I ended up getting way more drunk than I intended to, more than I originally thought I was at the time. 

By this point in the night, our other friends had mostly begin to filter out and go home. After saying goodbye to them, there was my roommate, me, the guy and his ride from earlier left in the house. My roommate went to the bathroom and I’m not sure where the ride went. I went to get up to put my glass in the sink in the kitchen, and in order to do so I had to walk around the coffee table. I don’t really know why I didn’t walk around all the couches, if I had maybe none of this would’ve happened. I hate myself for that. When I did this, I had my class in one hand and my phone in the other. As I walked around, he told me to come sit with him, and I said “no, I’m going to the kitchen” he said something else, then reached up and grabbed my hand that was holding my phone and pulled me down into his lap. I remember trying to get up and not being able to, dropping the glass onto the couch, and him putting my phone out of reach.

Apparently by this point, my roommate and the ride saw this, me on top of his lap, and decided that it was consensual, since I’d just broken up with my boyfriend and they’d seen him flirting with me afterwards. She also claims that she had asked me how I felt about him earlier in the night and I laughed but didn’t say anything, but I don’t remember this. Ultimately, my roommate and the ride decided not to intervene and the ride drove home and left the guy with me, and my roommate went to bed. 

The last thing I remember that night is being guided or carried into my room and the door slamming behind me. I remember also feeling overpowered and scared, because he was extremely tall, especially by my standards (I’m above 5’10 for reference without specificity). When I “came to” I was shaking uncontrollably in bed around 7/8am the next morning. I rolled over and someone was in bed next to me. I thought perhaps my roommate had left the door unlocked and my ex-boyfriend had come over to try and talk, found that I was too drunk and decided to stay. I checked my phone first for evidence of that, and of course there was nothing. Then I finally saw his face and realized what was going on. Panic set in, and there’s a lot of blanks after this too. I remember that he woke up like nothing was wrong and asked if I’d give him a ride home. I didn’t really know how to respond to that because I’ve never been good with confrontation. I took him home. As soon as he got out of my car, I broke down. I had the worst panic attack I’d ever had in the parking lot adjacent to his house. I was probably there for more than an hour, because I remember I didn’t get home until after noon. 

I tried to talk to my roommate about what happened, and we ended up falling out as friends because she didn’t believe I dare to accuse one of her friends of rape because she’d seen me sitting on his lap, which she took was being consensual. I don’t necessarily agree with that, but I honestly wasn’t in the right state of mind to argue with her over something I couldn’t remember or even begin to explain. She accused me of calling it rape to cover up me cheating on my boyfriend, but I hadn’t told her that we’d broken up already and wouldn’t believe me after I did. 

Honestly? I don’t know if this is actually rape. I’ll let you all answer that for me, I guess. But since then, I’m damaged. I was a victim of domestic abuse/violence two years before this happened, and the year in between I was drugged at a party and would’ve put money on me dying (but thankfully was well taken care of by kind strangers who have since become friends). The culmination of all of these things affects me every day. I’ve never had therapy, because my family does not believe in it, and even if they did approve, I couldn’t afford it. I can’t maintain or even desire being in a relationship, having sex is terrifying but I do it to make the other person happy and hope that one day I’ll just have sex and I won’t be scared anymore. I have flashbacks and random panic attacks  while out with friends, and now it’s affecting me at work due to what I do (ironically, therapy.) 

Any kind of advice or help you can offer me or even just talking to me would help at this point. I’m consistently sitting on the edge just waiting for the next traumatic thing to happen. I can’t live like this anymore.",tossinthisawaysohard,1,0,0,2020-01-21 4:51:04,rapecounseling
erqgdb,"Potentially Triggering: Just need to talk about my ex-boyfriend. He's filing a Title IX against me. I thought he was abusive to me, but now I'm questioning if I was in the wrong",1b,help-seeking,2,"Cole and I began dating towards the end of my freshman year. We had a relationship for a year and a half which was turbulent at times, but I learned a lot from him.

Early on, I made it clear that I was not comfortable having intimate relations with him and told him that I was not having sex for the remainder of my freshman year. He repeatedly pushed that boundary and would ask me to engage in acts I had refused to do. When I said “I would rather not. I’m sorry”, he would either tell me it was something his girlfriend did all the time and I needed to get over my conservative upbringing or he would tell me this was something he needed. He compared sex to hamburgers in one conversation and explained that if he hasn’t eaten, he can’t be a good boyfriend. Likewise, if he hasn’t had sex with me before we go out on a date, he can’t be a good boyfriend. I felt like I was doing something wrong by saying no, and I was told I was a bad girlfriend because wasn’t fulfilling my role. So I began letting him push that boundary.

I was inexperienced and had little to compare Cole with, but felt that physical intimacy with him was rougher than I wanted. After spending time with him, I would have bruises on my breasts, thighs, and neck and my nipples and lips would be bleeding. I would tell him to stop doing something because it hurt, and he wouldn’t. The first time he started chocking me he did not tell me what he was about to do and I was caught off-guard. I felt panicked and asked him to stop. I told him I wasn’t interested in that. A few days later he chocked me again, but this time he put one hand over my mouth so I couldn’t say anything. I didn’t know if this was normal or not, but I felt scared.

I had a mutual friend with Cole. While Cole and I were dating I confided my concerns to this friend. I wanted to know if this was normal and I wanted to know if he though Cole was a safe guy to be around. He recommended I get out of the relationship and told me what I was describing were red flags. The next day I tried to broach the topic with Cole. He told me that our friend had a crush on me and was trying to break us up. He told me that I shouldn’t listen to him and explained how much he cared about me. I believed Cole and continued in our relationship.

Over the summer we texted extensively. He invited me to visit him in his home state to meet his parents, but last minutes his parents turned out to be busy and it would just be me, him, and his sister in the house. During that visit, he told me he was worried that I was a quitter. I had asked to hold off on sex the first night because I was tired from my flight and didn’t think I would have fun. Cole told me I was giving up on him. He said that sex was something I had to work on, and I didn’t have a strong work ethic. That statement staid with me through our whole relationship and motivated me to do things when I didn’t want to. We ended up sleeping together that night. The following day I was supposed to meet his friends at a party. The whole day, Cole seemed to be in a bad mood. I asked him what was going on and he told me that he was embarrassed for his friends to see me. When I asked why he explained how beautiful his ex was, and that his friends would think less of him for dating someone who looked like me. My confidence was shaken going into meet his friends, and I felt like I was letting him down. He still slept with me that night after the party, and told me he didn’t understand why he was so attracted to me when I was objectively unattractive.

The next time we saw each other in person was the beginning of sophomore year. I was in town for my Dad’s conference and had gotten Cole an invitation to come to the events as my plus one. He picked me up from the airport and we were supposed to head straight to the hotel for the first event. I was anxious to be there on time, but he said he wouldn’t be able to focus and pulled off on a side street where he had me get into the back of the car. We arrived at the dinner late. During the week or so that I was in town, we were intimate regularly. He knew that I don’t drink, but one night towards the end of my visit he took me to his friend’s dorm and I had a few drinks. I blacked out, but the next morning Cole told me how much he had enjoyed last night. I told him I didn’t remember what had happened and felt a little freaked out. He said it wasn’t a big deal. We broke up, but two weeks later got back together. When we got back together he told me that the issues in the relationship were my fault – I wasn’t affection enough and didn’t give him enough attention, so I agreed to try again and that I would be better. I figured I had overreacted and that he was right – I was inexperienced with relationships and I had messed this up.

That semester I was in DC, but we would facetime every night. Cole wanted nudes, which I wasn’t comfortable sending, or for me to undress on the video. I was worried about my privacy, but he told me that he would break up with me if I didn’t. So I did. I felt like were spending too much time on the phone and wanted to have some space to explore DC. When I started making friends with other interns, though, Cole was concerned. He started to get depressed and said he needed me to be there for him. He told me he felt insecure about me spending time with other guys, and that I didn’t know they were hitting on me. I stopped hanging out with the male interns and spent more time on the phone with Cole in the evenings.

During this time, we started to talk about his relationship with sex. He told me he masturbated 8 times a week and honestly couldn’t get through a day without it. I suggested that he look into sex addiction meetings. I had been to AA meetings which had helped me, and I thought this might be a potential avenue for him. He apologized to me for using me to replace masturbation and told me how he didn’t see me as a person when we were sleeping together. I didn’t want to quit on him, and I offered to help support him through this and we would work things out. I suggested he try meeting with a sex therapist and sent him the contact info of some people in the Springs who he could look into. I told him that I obviously wasn’t a professional, but maybe someone else could help. It seemed like he wanted to do things differently and make a change, but then things shifted and he got angry with me for suggesting that his relationship with sex wasn’t healthy and told me I was the problem. He said the issue was my religion and how I had been taught to think about sex. I was open to trying to fix things on my end if that is what he needed.

Later he came out to visit me for a long weekend. I was excited to show him around and finally see him in person, but he wasn’t in a good mood. He asked to cancel the plans I had made for the first evening and sleep with me instead. He went out to get condoms and asked me to send him photos of myself while he was gone. I did. I knew he liked bondage and that was something I hadn’t been willing to do, but I thought it might cheer him up. So I blindfolded myself and tied myself to the bed just before he got back. He laughed when he saw me and then gagged me before having sex with me. He didn’t ask to gag me. I tried to spit it out and tell him to be gentler because my thighs were still bruised, but before I could finish speaking he had shoved it back in my mouth. When he was done, I started crying. I wanted to leave and go home for the night (we were renting an Air BnB because my lodgings were single sex). He grabbed my phone before I could call an Uber and convinced me to stay.

Before that same trip, I had told him nothing could happen during the one night we were staying at my parents’ house. He agreed at the time, but when we arrived he had me come down to the guest room and help him with his application for Honor Council. Then he told me to get in the shower, shoved me to my knees, grabbed my hair to the point where it hurt badly, and forced me on him until I was chocking. He did not stop when I tapped him and I threw up.

After the visit, I told him I needed some space. I told him it wasn’t his fault, but I needed to break up with him and take care of myself. The relationship had been wearing me down and I wanted to be able to enjoy my last month in DC. He still called me all the time after we broke up. During the holidays, he called me regularly telling me he was depressed and needed help. I tried to be there for him as a friend and as best I could. When second semester started we were both back on campus and I went to give him his things and take back my stuff which he had. He tried to hook up with me. I told him I didn’t want to get back together, so he proposed friends-with-benefits. I said no, but he continued to ask me. A few days later, I agreed. The sex got rougher. He had e buy him a pair of handcuffs and he bought a whip. He started using his pocket knife on me, drawing blood at times. He did not ask before using any of these items. We never came up with a safe word or a way for me to get him to stop if I needed him to. At the time, I started going on dinner-dates with other people. Cole got upset and gave me an ultimatum to pick him. I stopped going on dinner-dates.

After the ultimatum, we got back together. It was mostly just sex and a lot of it. I stopped spending as much time with my friends and would drop everything when he texted me to come over. Eventually I asked to try something that wouldn’t hurt me as much. He showed me the more “tame” porn he liked which was called something like free access where the woman just acts like nothing his happening. He would set me up watching Netflix or reading and tell me to act like it wasn’t even happening. I tried not to show that I was in pain. Sex with him was painful. He wasn’t interested in doing anything for me and did not engage in foreplay. It was a long time before he was willing to try using lube. I would tell him to stop when it hurt to much, but usually he wouldn’t. Things never got gentler. During this time we argued a lot, and I wasn’t happy. I don’t think he was either.

We took a road trip so I could help him drive his car home. He said he couldn’t go six days without sex. We got into a fight about that and he slept with me. Afterwards I told him I was upset he had done that and he shouldn’t have gone ahead with it when I wasn’t comfortable. He seemed upset after that told me to stay in Vegas and book a flight out from there. Eventually it blew over and he slept with me again the next day. The visit with his parents was more of the same. I wanted to meet them, but felt like we spend the majority of the trip in the guest room.

We texted during the summer until he came out to see me in July for my birthday. He picked out lingerie and asked me to buy it for when he came to visit. He didn’t communicate what he was doing, but the first or second morning he was in Colorado he basically acted out a rape fantasy which he had expressed having before. He asked me to put on the clothes he had me purchase and then ripped them off and shoved me to the ground. He chased me and restrained me while I fought back with all my might. He eventually was able to hold me down long enough to penetrate me. We both had injuries afterwards. He had not told me what was happening before he started and didn’t give me a safe word. I had no way of getting him to stop.

About a week later, I called him up in tears. I told him I was feeling suicidal and needed help. He contacted my mom who contacted my aunt in the Springs who showed up at the house I was staying at. I was upset with Cole for communicating to my mother. I yelled at him and told him never to contact me again. The next day I apologized and he said we were done. I agreed we should be over. I was at a conference in California later in early August. Cole and I had been planning to see each other for dinner, and he texted to ask if I still wanted to do dinner. I agreed and we confirmed that we would not be dating. When I arrived back on campus we tried to be friends. Within the first few weeks, however, we hooked up. I told him I did not want to go down the path of friends-with-benefits again. He told me maybe we could get back together. I thought I wanted that, and offered to try and make things work, but said I wasn’t sure I wanted to sleep with him until then. The constant back and forth relationship with Cole wore me down heavily during the first two blocks of this year. I started to reflect on the relationship and realized some problems I had taken for granted. I told Cole that he ought to know what he did wasn’t okay. I wanted some closure for myself and I genuinely don’t think he was aware how hurtful his actions had been. He was worried I might tell someone about what had happened between us. He said if I talked about our sex-life, it would ruin his life. He told me he would kill himself if I told anyone. The only way we could be friends, according to him, was if I made a video saying that any allegation I might ever make against him was false. The fact that he was that worried about me telling people did reinforce my suspicion that our sex life had been abusive, but I also felt an immense amount of guilt and worried that if I told anyone I would be responsible for hurting him.

For unrelated mental health reasons, I made a suicide attempt during the second month of school. The stress from my relationship with Cole didn’t help, but I would not blame him for my mental health issues. He came over that night after I had overdosed and was sleeping over when he realized I wasn’t okay. He asked what was going on and I told him I had overdosed earlier. We waited a few hours before going to the hospital. He visited me regularly when I was at the hospital and was immensely kind. He introduced himself to everyone as my boyfriend. Shortly after I got out, I decided to take him on a date and we hooked up afterwards. I thought we were dating at this point. The first words out of his mouth after we hooked up were “Obviously we aren’t dating, but that was fun”. I was heartbroken. He left to Greece the following day and we didn’t communicate much when he was in Greece.

When he got back to campus late November, we went back to trying to be friends. I was excited when he received the summer work he wanted. We kissed a few times, but neither of us wanted that to go anywhere. I started seeing someone else who I genuinely liked, and Cole was kind enough to drive me to get birth control. Then the break came. We fought constantly over the break. Holidays at home are hard for both of us, and we were both on edge. We brought up old fights over how I had hurt him in the past and how he had hurt me. He made threats about the pictures that he had. We decided to postpone the conversation until we were both in a better spot. When we scheduled to talk, though, he texted me to say he didn’t really want to talk and then he stopped responding to me. I didn’t know what was happening and was upset. I begged him to call me. I was worried he was going to do something with the photos he had of me. I started to draft a description of the issues in our relationship, but found it too hard to write about any of this. I still find writing about this hard. I told him to pick up the phone and talk to me before he did anything with my photos. Then I said I could post my experiences to Facebook if anything happened. But the truth was I couldn’t write it all out. On my personal facebook page, and ONLY my personal facebook page, I posted a short description of how he had emotionally worn me down. I had started with the easiest topic for me to discuss. He still did not get in touch with me. I later learned he contacted a close friend of mine who told him what the facebook page said. She did not tell me to take the post down. She read it and asked if I was okay. She supported and still supports my right to talk about how the relationship was emotionally and physically abusive as well as the impact which that has had on me.

After making the post, I immediately took it down. I remembered Cole’s threat and worried that he had hurt himself. I told him I was worried about that and was so sorry. I realized I had done something wrong by going public. I didn’t want him to get hurt. Eventually he responded and told me he was okay. We talked things out and agreed to go back to being friends.

This was the Facebook post:

&gt;As some of you may know, Cole Grubb and I were in an on-again off-again relationship for a year and a half. I wanted to take some space to talk about how that relationship impacted me.  
From the very beginning of our relationship, he made derogatory comments about my physical appearance on a regular basis. He told me it was good for me to hear these negative things because that way I would know the truth, and I believed him. But the comments wore me down over time. He hated all my clothes, my skin, my hair, and felt the need to comment on it regularly. When I was supposed to meet his friends for the first time, he told me he was embarrassed to introduce me as his girlfriend. He said his ex had been beautiful, and they would think less of him when he showed up with me. Those constant comments throughout our relationship hurt my confidence immensely, and what made it so much harder is that he would say these things and then be physically intimate with me. He said he didn’t understand why he was attracted to me. He told me it didn’t make any sense because I wasn’t objectively pretty — and then he would kiss me.

A few days later, he stopped responding. I was worried he had done something to hurt himself because he had been alluding to that during our conversations earlier. At this point I venmoed him to try and get a response and find out if he was okay. He responded and thanked me for my apologies and wanted to talk. He refunded me on venmo. A day or two later he asked for nudes. I sent them asked if he wanted to send any back. He said no because he didn’t trust me and then stopped responding. I was worried and asked him to delete my pictures. He didn’t respond until much later. At that point I decided it was best if we both took some space, so we stopped talking. A little later I started a new medical procedure that I assumed he would want to be informed of and texted him that I was beginning that. He never responded. I stopped reaching out until I saw notifications saying that he was unliking and unhearting texts from our older conversations. I tried to get in touch with him to ask what was going on. He never responded.

During this winter break I had a life-changing experience with the new person I was seeing. I assumed after the relationship with Cole that rough sex was just what guys liked. The person I was seeing later told me the sex we were having had been rough, but I had been desensitized to what rought was. At least he would ask me for a blow job rather than just physically making me do it. When he pulled my hair it was never so hard that it hurt. When I asked to stop something, he would. He never bruised me or hurt me. He checked in with how I was doing. Later on I offered to try out a rape fantasy, but halfway through he stopped. He asked me if I was enjoying it and I said sure, it was fine. To be honest, it had been a long time since I had even considered if I enjoyed a sexual act or not. He said I seemed scared and we didn’t have to do this. He was right. I was scared and remembering all the things that had been done to my body in the past. I burst into tears. I hadn’t realized what Cole and I were doing wasn’t the way things had to be. I hadn’t realized how much I had hated it. To have someone here who was trying to check in with me, give me an opportunity to have a safe word, and be careful about actually hurting me was revolutionary. I cried and told him what my sex life had looked like. He was shocked. It was the first time anyone else had told me that what Cole and I had been doing wasn’t normal and it felt so validating. I had come to view sex as something scary and painful that I was obligated to do. This guy offered to take things really slow and focus on what I enjoyed and help me find out what I enjoyed. Cole had never done anything which would have been pleasurable for someone with my anatomy. I am still rebuilding the scars that relationship left behind and am finally learning what it means to have someone respect my body. I am finally learning what it means to do what I like rather than what someone else likes at the expense of my well-being.

Just as I was coming to terms with the idea that maybe I had spent a year and a half in an abusive relationship, that maybe this relationship I had escaped was part of why I had become so unhappy, I received a Title IX order. Cole’s Mom had filed a report regarding the Facebook post. It initially felt invalidating – I was the perpetrator, so maybe all that stuff Cole had done was acceptable. I was the one in the wrong. That revolutionary moment was just some guy overreacting to a perfectly normal story. Maybe we were both at fault here, and we were both victims in some sense? Can the relationship was toxic and abusive, but neither one of us are individually at fault.

I know that he could easily write six pages about all the ways I hurt him. He had to deal with me being needy and making a threat to post something on Facebook. I know what I did posting that was wrong. Threatening anyone’s reputation for any reason is unacceptable and I feel pretty ashamed about how I handled that situation. He also put up with a lot from me when I was dealing with my depression and anxiety, and he was there for me during a lot of it.

I'm terrified to go forward during this Title IX investigation. I don't have a good relationship with school admin and I've never told anyone about these problems except for the guy I'm currently seeing. I don't want to drag out the process - the sooner it is over the better - but when I write my response, I could include some of the problems I faced in the relationship and have my story hear. I want to move on, but I also want Cole to know how much damage he did, how many scars he left behind, and how his actions had consequences for me. 

Honestly, I would be happy if he gets that no contact order. It will help me from falling back into a toxic relationship, and it will be a very long time before I get into another relationship. Clearly I was unstable, mean, and insecure. I have a lot to work on before I can be a good partner for anyone. If any one has advice for how I can deal with my end, I'd appreciate it.

I know this is a long post, but I could use some validation, to be frank. Do you think I was in the wrong? What can I work on here? Was this abuse from him, or is it all in my head? Was I the abusive one here?",AnyMouseCanSpeak,1,0,0,2020-01-21 6:02:25,rapecounseling

erw6hs,My Partner is Struggling With My Rape. Advice?,1b,help-seeking,2,"It’s been over a month since I was raped and I’m making progress. My therapy has been helpful. I’m sleeping and eating again. Honestly looking back on everything, I’m amazed I’m doing so well. My partner is a saint. He has supported me and been taking care of our toddler while I’ve been a shell of a human being. He has been understanding about us sleeping separately and been kind and slow and communicative during sex. 

I’m bisexual, and I am a female married to a male. No that doesn’t make me straight because I settled down with someone of the opposite gender that I love with all my heart. My husband voiced last night that he was scared and having negative thoughts that I was going to struggle being married to him. Because I am scared of men. Because I instantly wake up as soon as he enters the room. Because I have involuntary twitches as a result of my anxiety and I twitch a lot with him. He mentioned that I would be more comfortable with a female partner. He’s never felt insecure about my sexuality because like I choose him out of all them men I have dated, I also chose him out of all the women I dated. He never felt like he was going to lose me one day because of his genitalia. 

I reassured him that I love HIM and that I am working as hard as I can to be able to sleep in bed with him again and I don’t want anyone else. I just want him. I don’t need a female partner to feel safe otherwise I wouldn’t beg him to be at home with me or feel afraid when he is gone. I love my husband with all of my being and I hate that he feels responsible for my pain and fear. 

I feel so much pain for the pain I caused him. His partner was raped and there was nothing he could do to stop it. He must feel powerless and like a failure. My rapist told him that he was at fault for leaving me at that party, he said “this is partly your fault because you let her get drunk and left her there.” Which if I see that fucker in public, the first throat punch is for verbally attacking my husband. Stupid prick. 

How do I help him? How can I make him feel better?",deeplynugget,1,0,0,2020-01-21 15:33:05,rapecounseling

2 days ago,  my girlfriend was assaulted on the city bus. She was the only one riding when a man sat next to her. He grabbed her thigh and threatened to kill her if she screamed. He dug into her thigh hard enough to leave bruises. He ripped her underwear and penetrated her with his fingers. 

She was staring at the driver the whole time, but he didn't notice. She is terrified of making a report or even leaving her house. 

I live over an hour away and I can't get to her. She can't get to me because she's terrified of the bus and she can't drive. She begged me not to tell anyone. I don't know what to do.",MisterFrogJudgesYou,1,0,2,2020-01-21 18:25:48,rapecounseling
es2dt8,Was I rape or was this sexual assault? (Long post),1b,help-seeking,3,"I met a guy off a dating app. We went out on one date. I thought he was attractive but I was still unsure. After the date he texted me to asked if I was a virgin? I admitted it yes. He then asked “If I wanted sex?”
Here’s the part when I should I said “no” and I would move on with my life. Since I am in my 30’s and never had a boyfriend and pressured by my mom to get marry. I thought here’s someone that is interested in you, why not give him a chance? I told him I was not ready, and he told me he will wait. 

Three weeks has pass and I texted him if he wanted to hang out with me for cuddling? He agreed. So I’m at his place expecting we’ll just watched a movie and cuddle. We started to cuddle for 5-10 minutes, he then started to fondle my boobs. It felt good, I was turn on, so we ended up kissing. He ended up guiding my hand to his dick, everything was new to me so I was amused and excited. I thought this was just a normal thing when you’re exploring another person’s body. I was naive and inexperienced.

The next week, I went to his place again for “cuddling and kissing.” After we cuddle, we removed our clothes. He then fondled me down there and now he wants to put it in. I still was not turn on after 10 minutes, but my mind was telling me here is a guy that is really into you, just do it since I thought sex was the way to build a loving relationship. I wanted what every couple has done. I was in the moment. I asked him to go gentle. He then put on a condom and put it. I screamed when he shoveled in but he told me since it’s my first time it’s going to hurt. It was in for a few seconds but I wanted him to pull out immediately since I was in pain. I didn’t tell him to stop but kept on telling him it hurts. He then stated “if he pulls out and put it in again it’s going to hurt even more.” He then just f**** me, I didn’t fight back because I thought this was normal. I did bleed but he allowed me to shower afterwards and gave me a bottle of water. 

Afterwards I proceeded to breakup with him, we fought over texts. He tells me “I will never meet a guy that will respect me as [him], he likes me because I’m smart and nice. Every other guy will want to f**k you.” So, we didn’t breakup. I continuously kept on seeing him and the only thing we ever did was sex, he promised me that we will go out on dates, but we never did. Each time I prep myself before seeing him, but would always felt something was missing after we had done it. There was no cuddling or affection after our sex. 

When I asked him if he wanted to go to an event with me, he declined and stated I never gave him oral. I stated I was unsure. He then wanted to end things with me, I beg him not to because I thought we could work out our relationship p. He then threatened to block me from his life if I don’t give him oral. He wanted me to come over ASAP or tomorrow to give him the best oral or else he will end our relationship. I know I was stupid and desperate and gave in. So I studied everything on oral sex and came to his place to do it. I couldn’t even turn him on, so he proceeded to just stick it in down there to f**k me. I moved my pelvis so I can pull away because he was being intense, but he thought I wanted it even more and so continued to f**k me harder. After he got off he then cums on my body. I felt weird then just left. 

The day after, he told me I know nothing about oral sex and then broke off with me. I was angry, confused, and sad and didn’t know what I did wrong. But I knew I despised him. 

Is this sexual assault or rape? I met a counselor today and told her this. She told me if I didn’t wanted it, then it’s trauma. She gave me a list of sexual trauma centers if I decided to proceed with it. I don’t know anything anymore. This.",Murky_Sense,1,0,8,2020-01-21 22:38:07,rapecounseling
es406r,2 months ago I was sexually assaulted by my now ex-boyfriend,1b,rant,2,"Both of us are 19. Two months ago sexually assaulted me. I’ve talked about it so much with friends at this point that discussing it has become tiresome and honestly quite triggering. I will not go into detail for this reason, but what occurred is essentially what is known as “stealthing.”

These past months have been the hardest months of my life mentally. This was someone who I really really cared about, who I confided so much in and trusted so much. Somebody who knew how much I’d been hurt before (familial issues mostly) and nonetheless hurt me in one of the worst ways possible.

I only recently broke up with him. My boyfriend was very remorseful after the incident and still is per the last time I spoke to him (I said goodbye to him officially today and that I don’t wish to have contact with him anymore - I have deleted his number and blocked him on all social media). We had been dating for five months and he was really one of my best friends. I know he isn’t a bad person. And I know how much he proclaims to love and care about me. I know he has a conscience. I know he feels absolutely horrible for what he did to me. And that’s also what makes this hard: trying to reconcile a good person with a heinous act.

I’ve suffered from anxiety and depression for years now. I will be going to therapy soon and have made an appointment with my doctor to go back on meds (I stopped taking them in the summer).

I just feel absolutely hopeless and terrible. Life has so little colour and I can’t concretely think about the future. I’m in such unimaginable pain and I can’t even properly describe it. Going to class is a chore. Reading is a chore. Getting out of bed is a chore. I have genuinely lost my entire will to live. I fear that it will not get any better. I have lost all hope. I don’t know what to do.",francinebeenfrensky,1,0,1,2020-01-22 0:36:47,rapecounseling
es445s,"(Long post) Grey area, not sure if this was or wasn't and need help for the next steps",0,help-seeking,3,"This is one of those stories where I feel like you need a lot of detail to understand it so this might get a tiny bit graphic and is going to be a very long story.

Here's some background, I started dating this guy (we'll call him ex 2) very soon after the break up of a 2 year relationship with another guy (ex 1). Everyone involved (including me) is aged 18-19

This guy (ex 2) seemed to be a pretty perfect match for me, we had similar hobbies and interests to the point of some overlap but not too much, we both loved each other's personalities and bodies, he was kind and caring but strong, sex was great for both of us (he was the first person to manage to overcome the barrier from sexual assault at a much younger age that stopped me from enjoying sex as much), etc. The only noticeable issues were that the relationship moved a bit too quickly for me and he wasn't as cautious of boundaries as he probably should have been but nothing that set off any alarm bells, and it was his first actual relationship.

Fast forward a month into the relationship and we were getting ready to go out when I told him that if I consented to sex later on (when drunk), it counted as consent (I am obviously aware that's not how it works with most people but I felt comfortable with that). We went out, had drinks with friends (I drank more than him because his meds meant he couldn't) and came back to my house and went to the bedroom. 

He tried to initiate sex for a few minutes before realising that it wouldn't go in without some lube. I think I said something like ""Its too cold, can we just have hugs?"" just before it went in. He had sex with me for about 2 or 3 minutes before I tapped out (we had a safe word but I struggle to speak during sex, I don't think he was fully aware of that at the time). He stopped and asked me if I tapped out, I nodded, then he asked what was wrong, I think I repeated what I said earlier. He then mentioned that he'd struggle to sleep if he didn't orgasm (this is a legitimate issue he has). I suggested he jerked off on me to which he replied that it would make a lot of mess so I said he could continue having sex with me. At some point soon after he started again he put a blanket over my top half (he has consistently said afterwards that this was to keep me warm because I complained I was cold, I believe he's being truthful about this). This however had the inadvertent effect of somewhat restraining me even though I only remember him holding down the blanket closest to him due to him needing to hold himself up. I believe him when he says it wasn't meant to restrain me in any way but it did and that meant that when I wanted to tap out again a minute or so later, I couldn't and therefore he kept going. I also found myself unable to say the safe word for the second time. After he finished he must have seen that I was a tiny bit unresponsive and asked how I was. I think I said it hurt a bit at first but felt good towards the end (I have difficulty orgasming to the point where it's a gamble and you have to do absolutely everything right but enjoy sex so it's normal for me to not finish). He said he was sorry it hurt at first but glad it felt good afterwards and after a few minutes we went to sleep.

The next morning I brought it up with him but I think I downplayed it a lot to the point where it didn't seem too serious. He said/seemed sorry to have upset me but was under the impression it wasn't that severe, I don't think he'd realised exactly what had happened either so we both shrugged it off after a brief conversation and pretty much went about as normal though he definitely seemed a lot more cautious regarding whether or not I wanted sex after that incident. This wasn't to say everything was perfect (he crossed a boundary within one of our kinks a lot later on but it was an understandable mistake) but he definitely seemed to make an effort to not make the same mistake ever again.

Fast forward to about a week into the new year and I haven't seen him since the 2nd of January. The effect that the incident had on me suddenly started to materialise and I broke down. I reached out to ex 1 (who was still friends with me) to talk about what happened in confidence because I didn't feel I could approach ex 2 about it and ex 1 never pushed anything I didn't want but we weren't the best match. Ex 1 really hates ex 2 because he feels like he broke up our relationship (he didn't really, though he did unintentionally catalyse the break up by just being there) so I knew he wouldn't be unbiased but I like ex 2 so much that I'm probably biased towards him myself. After speaking with him I decide to break up with ex 2 so I can both overcome the trauma that the incident has brought up (both from when I was sexually assaulted by an older child when I was still in primary school and from when I felt trapped and unable to do anything from the more recent unwanted experience) and fully get over my previous relationship which I realised I wasn't completely over around the same time.

Ex 2 seemed upset but said he understood my reasoning and he agreed it was for the best. At the time I think I stressed me not being over my previous relationship (I don't want to restart it but I'm not ready to date others just yet) more than the incident so I think he saw that as the main reason.

I don't really feel like myself anymore, I feel pretty helpless since I didn't feel like I could have done anything to stop that situation and it just happened. It feels like a part of me was taken away.

I don't remember exactly how it happened but at some point I talked to him about how much the incident had actually affected me and he seemed genuinely devastated that he could have done something to hurt me like that. I mentioned from the beginning that it definitely feels like a grey area and there didn't seem to be any intent behind it therefore I'm not going to the police about it so he's not just pretending to be sorry to avoid that. He's normally fairly calm and collected but he's been a bit all over the place since, I even discovered recently that he was so upset with himself that he had self harmed the same night I told him how it had hurt me. There have been times where he seems certain he's effectively guilty of rape and times when he seems certain it doesn't fit the definition but makes a point of saying that doesn't mean what he did wasn't wrong and that it doesn't diminish the severity of the pain its caused me in any way. To add to all this he's also said countless times that he's willing to do literally anything to help me or make it up to me, even if it only helps a little bit and requires excessive effort on his part.

We're still on friendly terms but have agreed to not message or see each other in private for a while so we can get our thoughts straight because I still feel like him being around influences me too much. I've had to hide his contact on my phone otherwise it's too tempting to talk with him. I'm currently trying to collect and make notes of my thoughts to take into counselling/therapy which I recently signed up for.

To make things slightly more tricky, he's said that if I'm comfortable with him after therapy that he wants to try again. He's stated that he'd only want this to happen if I'm comfortable with it/want it and only after I've gone through therapy. He said the same thing about accepting forgiveness from me, he'll only accept it as true after I've been through therapy.

I feel like the whole thing is in a grey area and don't know what to do about it. I'm going to therapy regardless and have suggested the idea of both going to therapy together (he agreed he'd definitely go if I wanted him to) but am still slightly unsure. If I do feel comfortable with him after therapy (I'm not now and don't know if I will be) should I give him a second chance? His promises to ensure nothing remotely like this happens again seem sincere and so do all of his apologies and offers to try and help but all that'll really help at the moment is giving me some space which is difficult for both of us to maintain. 

If anyone could offer any advice that would be greatly appreciated as I'm really unsure of everything at the moment.",MeganW71,1,0,0,2020-01-22 0:45:06,rapecounseling
es5r4g,Does it make sense for me to be upset over this?,1b,help-seeking,1,"Nearly two weeks ago I got beyond drunk. I lost about 5-6 hours of time entirely. It was my own fault for not knowing my limits and drinking jasgerbombs when I normally only drink beer. 

My friend took us back to her friends place and I fell down a flight of stairs and just kept falling in general. I was told this as I had no idea why I was in pain the next morning and covered in bruises. 

I apparently sat on a guys lap as well as my female friends laps too. But I have a boyfriend so this was really upsetting to learn. I told him right away and he was annoyed but is more concerned with how drunk I was because when I came home I wasn’t making any sense. 

Apparently the guy whose lap I sat on told my friend a few says later “I could have so easily fucked her”. 

This is really upsetting me and I’m not sure why. I have been sexually assaulted (I think) in the past and I think the idea of the possibility of having sex with this guy and not remembering it at all is really freaking me out.",vitalogy95,1,0,2,2020-01-22 2:56:22,rapecounseling

es7201,My GF was assaulted and it created an emotion mess between us. Need some advice,1b,help-seeking,3,"Hi brave people of this subreddit.  


I come here to ask for advice and guidance as this has been very difficult for both of us. I would like to keep it short but I think it will be kinda hard, but will try my best.  


I am in a relationship that's been going for almost 8 years now. We know each other since high school, we were really good friend back then and after high school we started hanging up more and things just happened.  


Things were going pretty good between us but unfortunately she decided to pursue her dream of living in another country and also, it is temporary so we decided to keep a long distance relationship. Even with that, the relationship was going strong, even stronger I would argue, every time we saw each other was a moment of celebration. It felt that every time we saw each other we were more and more mature.  


Unfortunately, she met a person who was her ""Friend"". This person was a complete asshole, as he had a crush on her, but she said that she loved me and she could only give her friendship to him. The problem is that this person has had a very troubled life and he has a depressive personality. He constantly said suicidal thoughts to my GF and also has anger management issues.  


My GF is a very soft spoken and she has been depressed in her life in the past. So she understood how that could feel, so she was always hanging with this guy trying to making him feel better. Unfortunately this turned into a very toxic relationship where he was controlling her. She went to the movies with him or for dinner with him because whenever things didn't go his way, he always responded very aggressively and the suicide threads where common in this relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

I of course helped my GF, sometimes she would call me crying because how this person made her feel, so I always stood for her and told her ""You have to stop talking to him dear, he is making you feel like shit, that is not a good thing for you."". I even remember saying ""This will not end good for you"". My GF understood all that I said but she said ""Nothing will happen, don't worry"".  


She also used to have panic attacks whenever this person got angry. She was always like scared whenever he got angry. She wasn't able to react or say anything and sometimes she ended up doing things secretly without him so he wouldn't get angry at her.  


She hanged out with him as even though he has those problems, there were some like... good aspects of him? Like he was an asshole, but sometimes he could be funny and with more people around it was easier for her to hang up with him. So she decided to focus on the positive aspects of him.  


Last year, this person went to my GF apartment, which she was stressed as she always had those problems with him. She laid down on her bed because she was stressed of him AND she was having surgery next week when this happened. This person laid down as well and kissed her. She apparently was in shock and then this guy proceeded to assault her.   


My GF reacted and said ""No, not that, not that, no no"" and she covered her body. Aparently more time lapsed and this guy did it again. And she didn't stopped him.  


I want to clarify, I am going to therapy and I am reading a book and yes, I do understand that freezing is a real thing and hard to control. It's taking me months to stop feeling bad for her freezing. But it is very hard as when she told me the whole story, she told me that she wasn't really scared? And she never felt froze? she was more as in.... in a disassociation state which also I can understand. But it is very hard as apparently the guy didn't go aggressive at all. He just did his thing and when he wanted sex she said no again, and then he stopped.  


I know this is sexual assault. But I am having a hard time with my feelings. And I can explain why:  


When my GF told me the whole story, she basically said: I cheated you. She noticed my reaction and proceeded to tell me what happened with a lot of details, which creating an incredible nasty story in my head which I can't get out. Even still, I noticed there was some parts that sounded like sexual assault.  


I decided to ask her:  
Did he kissed you? Or it was a mutual kiss?  


To which she replied that it was a mutual one. That's when everything collapsed in me.  


Fast forward a few weeks, she talked to a professional and thats when she talked to me again and she said that she was sorry and that she basically mangled the whole story. She was feeling guilty but that it was not her fault. It was not a mutual kiss, it was more as in he kissed her and she was in shock and didn't pushed him away and that made her feel extremely guilty and that's why she said it was mutual, but after talking with a professional she was able to tell me the truth.  


That being said, it has not being easy to forget that day. I have a trauma. The worst part of my life so far is when my ex gf cheated on my for real, twice. I feel like I will never forget those days. I remember I reacted poorly to the whole situation, and my GF was super cute and had a good body. We were at engineering school and because there are not  a lot of woman and also not a lot of good looking woman people decided to side to her and a lot of people pointed at me as a looser. A looser who cried for his GF, and Looser and a asshole. How somebody like me could've been with somebody who was craved by the whole faculty?. It was the first time in my life where I made enemies.  


It took me years on depression, therapy and antidepressants to finally come out on top. I finally moved on and that year when I finally got out, I felt like I stepped out of my shell. When that happened is when I finally felt like I was able to give people love again and started having a crush on my current GF and she also had a crush on me.  


So basically, when she told me the whole story, things just collapsed inside me. I have a lot of feelings and memories of those moments. My GF cried that day and she told me that she didn't want to make me live again the same situation and she was very sorry. Now she says it is not our fault and we should be able to move forward.  


She has been a champ throughout this whole situation, giving me support and acknowledging that she screwed up by telling me the way she did. She agrees that she should've tried to not ignore the assault (it took her 6 months to tell me and didn't talk about it with anybody) as she was trying to feel like nothing happened, which I also can understand.

&amp;#x200B;

Now the real problem is my feelings. My feelings are a complete mess. I am in depression, I sleep so little and a lot at the same time. I barely eat and I am always tired and sad. I am unfortunately disappointed of her. Is not the assault that disappoints me? Is the fact that we both knew this guy was a fucking asshole and she never put a stop to it. Even to this day.  


She says that she doesn't want to report him to the police because the country where she lives is very male oriented and nothing will happen. I can understand that.  


She also don't want to talk to the staff (It was a co worker) because she doesn't want to make this ""Big"". I also understand that, but I disagree with this one. I feel like this guy should be punished and fired from the place and kicked back to his own country. This part starts to make me feel the disappointment as I want to hear from her that she finally exploded, but she didn't.  


She also don't want to talk with her friends. She already did with two of her friends, but one part of her friends are still on touch with this guy and it is like his only friend. I want to feel like this guy at least lost all his friends because of this, because my GF gets along more with them than them with this asshole. But she is afraid of her friends talking with her assaulter and him convincing them with words as in ""She wanted it"" or ""It was not assault"". She is also afraid of him getting angry and going to my GF's place and having a discussion, she says that she could not handle that.  


I am disappointed in feeling that she is lacking courage :(. Yes, I can sound like a jerk, and I am aware of that, that's why I come here for advice. I don't feel like I love her right now, but I am afraid of not feeling the excitement ever again. We were talks on getting married and she also is moving to my country (I also moved from my home country) this year. We're still on plans on doing that as we saw each other on the holidays and things were good. Not great mind you, but good. And the bad parts weren't bad? It was more as in getting sad, crying, hugging and exchanging feelings.  


But the truth is, I am terrified of my feelings. My mind know this is not the same case. My mind knows this is a very complicated matter and nothing is white and black. But my feelings are a complete mess. I used to feel at ease whenever I saw her, now I am afraid of not recovering that feeling.  


I am disappointed of her not exploding and hitting the desk and yelling ENOUGH, before, during and after the assault. I just wish she exploded, didn't matter if it was after the assault, I just want to feel that she can fight him. I am also disappointed that we both knew this guy was an asshole, if only she would've listen to me, thing would be sooo different.  


I also feel like and asshole because she also had a traumatic experience. I don't know what to do. I am so lost. I don't trust her right now, and I don't know what to do. I know she didn't cheat, and she would never do that to me. Even yesterday talking about this she said: I didn't cheat you and I never will and you know that! I know is hard because of how I said things, but that does not count. I know the shock is still there, but you have to focus on the truth. I was assaulted, it took me 6 months to finally understand that. You have to have hope on yourself. You have to have hope on you leaving this behind.  


The truth is, I don't really have that hope in me. Last time this feeling destroyed me. This feeling got the best of me, and it is doing it now. My mind can picture him doing all the things she described and my gut goes crazy.  I still remember that day. That day I am not sure I can forget.  


Should I just ignore my feelings? Well not ignore ignore, more as in, live with them? Should I trust my gut? Should I trust my brain? Can these feelings fade away? Can I recover that excitement? We will be able to marry as we were planning to do?  


Thanks for the reading and I hope you have a great night.",emotional_wreck_2,1,0,12,2020-01-22 4:49:52,rapecounseling

I always call it non consensual sex, or some other avoidant way. I was mostly hurt because he watched me slowly recover from the violence I had endured previously. 

We talked, he was remorseful. Years later, and he’s still one of my best friends. We still have sex when we are around each other ...

But when I’m quiet, I feel shame. I feel ashamed I forgave him. I feel shame that I’m still his friend. I feel ashamed that I keep this secret to myself.

es7zvx,"I can’t actually remember it happening, but know it did",1a,help-seeking,3,"CW for somewhat graphic discussion of CSA

I’m an FTM transgender man struggling with the realisation that a big ball of previously unexplained and rather concerning behaviours, memories and attitudes in my life were because I had been raped as a child. I’m in ongoing counselling about it all but I’m getting very messed up by the fact that I can’t remember exactly what happened. All I have are memories of the aftermath, and of what it did to me emotionally and mentally, but the rape itself is just a big blank. Not being able to remember the details is making me feel like I have no right to be having panic attacks when something sets me off thinking about it, and no matter how much concrete evidence I have that it happened (aside from the psychological effects CSA has, there were physical injuries to my genitalia that a sibling blithely confirmed as real and not misremembered) I can’t seem to wrap my head around what was done to me. 

I’ve been working through trigger logs with my therapist, noting what sets me off and what it does to me, but it’s still having effects on my life and relationships. I managed to tell my partner (also FTM) after three months, but while he’s very supportive and comforting, there’s only so much I can actually discuss before triggering his PTSD from his own rape. My best friend knows that there’s something serious that’s fucking me up and has calmly said she’ll help however she can and if I ever want a listening ear, she’s here for me, but I can’t bring myself to even begin to think of telling her because it’s such a taboo thing. 

It’s building up and having to wake from nightmares of being raped and then spend days feeling like my body is being touched all over again without any ways of alleviating it is wearing me down more than anything I know how to handle. My main coping mechanism is to just write everything I think and feel about this down as it happens, so I’ll remember it after the dissociation ends and I’ll know what happened during that time. Most things, like distractions or grounding techniques, just don’t work. I’ve even found myself deliberately resorting to coping mechanisms my younger self used to cope with the onset of puberty and sex drive (deliberately seeking out triggering material so that I can make my trauma feel real even if I can’t remember it).

esjhzx,Last night my best friend (M18) pressured me (M18) into preforming sexual acts on him.,1b,help-seeking,3,"My best friend and I have known each other since the begining of high school. We've always been really close, and we've both been open with each other about having bisexual tendencies, but never expressed any romantic/sexual interest in each other. 

Last night he asked if he could come over to hang out and I agreed. Most of the night was normal. We listened to music, played smash bros, etc. etc. all while smoking the weed he brought over so we were both getting really stoned, which, as I previously stated, was pretty normal. 

Things started getting strange when he told me to ditch the chair I brought into my room and suggested we sit together on my bed. I didn't think too much about it and obliged. He then got progressively closer and closer to me and started putting his hands on me. I tried pushing him away but he kept telling me to ""calm down"" or ""chill"" so I kinda just let him get as close as he wanted, either from being too high to care or not knowing how to react to him being affectionate with me. It was also getting close to midnight and I was getting tired. I then noticed he had unzipped his pants. At this point I knew exactly what he wanted from me and kinda just froze. He started getting more grabby with me and I tell him multiple that I'm high and that I don't know what I'm doing. He doesn't stop, I don't remember what exactly he was saying. He tried getting ontop of me and I tried to keep him away with my foot. He says ""If I didn't respect you I'd be a lot meaner."" He says that a couple times. He also says ""Maybe I should be meaner"" and complains that my foot is hurting him at which point I cave in and let him get ontop of me. (Also I feel like I should clarify that what he was saying to me didn't sound threatening or mean at the time.)

After what felt like an eternity of him trying to kiss me and trying to convince me to do things to him I decided my best option was to give him what he wanted so he would leave me alone. We switched positions and I performed oral sex on him until he was satisfied. He then got an uber home.

I don't really know what to think about what happened and a lot of the details are still blurry. All I know is that I never said yes or no and told him multiple times that I was unsure and very intoxicated. I found it really hard to sleep last night, kinda just kept telling myself it was normal or not as bad as it could've been. I can't shake the gross feeling I have and I can't stop thinking about it. I've randomly broken out into tears today even though at times I feel nothing towards it. I don't know who to turn to, don't know what I should do, don't even know if what happened is considered 'rape' or 'sexual assault'... The fact that he's never done anything like this before doesn't help and the fact that I really enjoy being his friend doesn't help either. I just feel sick and don't know what I should do or how to cope. If anyone has any advice or any input at all it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks

TL;DR: I was pressured by my best friend into giving him oral sex. I don't know if what happened is considered rape and I don't know what to do about it.",spalpymagee,1,0,0,2020-01-22 22:36:26,rapecounseling
eskp1g,What would this be considered?,1b,help-seeking,2,"I’ve recently entered a PHP program (partial hospital) I have quite a few mental health issues among other environmental problems. 
After my intake/evaluation I was placed in trauma track for ptsd and some red flags.
I’m enjoying the program so far and it’s helping but I’m unsure about some of what I’ve been through I flip and flop and feel embarrassed and guilty over the situation that has traumatized me not being serious or big enough . I don’t want to insult other people’s real issues . I expressed my feelings to a counselor and they said I’m having trouble with “radical acceptance” I really just need an outside honest opinion on my story.

I was in a toxic relationship in high school my junior year his senior year. He could definitely be considered emotionally abusive , manipulative and favored gaslighting . 
I can’t quiet remember very big details of the day it happened only a year ago did I even remember what happened after repressing it for 4 years.  I was triggered when my friend and I were talking about the past and he had mentioned what my ex used to say about me after we broke up. The main one “yeah she took my virginity it wasn’t even good” and then a lot of it just flooded back I became teary eyed and frustrated cuz he didn’t elaborate the fact that I lost my virginity too and I didn’t want it to happen.
The day of him and I planned to have sex condom , no clothes ect.  But when he actually started to penetrate me it was too painful and I said it hurt and I wanted it to stop. He got upset and said “if you can’t do it now what makes you think you’ll ever be able to do it” I didn’t want him to be upset I didn’t respond. He told me to get on top of him and said “go at your own pace” so I complied still not saying anything.  It was reverse cow girl I did not want to face him now. I don’t remember if I had started crying yet. 
But my “pace” wasn’t fast enough and he grabbed my hips pushed them down on top of him essentially forcing it in.  I was crying now I don’t think I physically did much I remember looking back and seeing how disappointed and miserable he was. He tried to get me to bounce or move but ultimately gave up.  There was a lot of blood I knew there would be some but seeing it almost sent me into a shock. He just got annoyed with my being upset and flushed the condom. I don’t remember anything after that.
We dated for more months after that about 2 and according to old messages everything was fine. I told him I was still in pain but I did it flirtatiously so it wouldn’t count.",danii4121k,1,0,2,2020-01-23 0:03:43,rapecounseling

esnut2,No memory of what happened as a kid,1a,help-seeking,3,"TW for the obvious, discussion of my experience

(I am an FTM transgender man; at the time of the abuse I was for all intents and purposes a young cisgender girl). 

I’m working through the realisation that several concerning things in my life were the result of being raped as a child. It’s been almost six months since that bombshell hit, and I’ve been in active therapy coming to terms with what I’ve remembered, but worse than what I’ve remembered is what I haven’t. I have no memory of the rape itself, only the aftermath (being awake too late at night crying with injured genitals, using masturbation as self harm before I even hit double digits, having a panic attack the first time I penetrated myself and the fear whenever I tried again, the nightmares). There are flashes of things that I heavily suspect have something to do with what happened (fingers, school bathrooms, the very publicly known fact that my single abusive mother didn’t listen to a word I said however serious) but I just can’t remember what actually happened. At all. 

It’s affecting me in bad ways. I find myself either spiralling and panicking because I can feel the body flashbacks or my thoughts are raving about how this isn’t something that just happened to me, it’s something someone did. My partner has been a godsend, able to talk with me about it with the understanding of someone who went through the same thing, and he’s very helpful with the loss of ability to receive sexual contact even when I still want to have sex, but even with his listening ear I feel lost because he eventually remembered his rape whereas mine is still just... gone. My therapist assured me that from what other mental health we’ve discussed I already had dissociation problems and so it makes a great deal of sense that I would experience the dissociative tendency to repress the memory, but I still keep losing my cool with myself because I feel like all the evidence I have that if did happen are useless without the memory. 

I also feel a bit wrongfooted because my best friend is doing her best to be supportive but is concerned because she doesn’t know what’s going on. She knows that there is a specific thing that has been causing depressive and dissociative episodes, but in the same way I did before I was ready to tell my partner, it’s referred to only as That Problem. We usually have completely unfiltered communication around all our issues, however personal and/or traumatic, and so it’s difficult to see the concern in her face when she’s comforting me and saying that she’s gonna help however she can and reminding me that I don’t ever have to tell her what That Problem is but if I do want to she’s always here. I can’t process sharing with her what’s going on because I know it’s out of her frame of experience - when she found out my partner was raped after accidentally triggering his PTSD, her only response was a distraught ‘Fuck,’ and it never came up again.

Thankfully she is really empathetic and makes this process easier than I thought

She says there's enough evidence to charge him.

Because it was my boss. With all the people I've told, the other boss who I told 2 years ago, doctor and psychologist records, the fact he recently tried to make a move on another girl (also from his staff) and because his lips touched hers it's also assault. And she's a witness.

I still don't know what he could say when they interview him. But this feels good at least.

et15nb,Unpopular personal opinion: I don’t want to be referred to as a “survivor” and I don’t need to forgive my abusers.,1b,survey,2,"I’d like to know if anyone else can relate to this.

I’m in no way saying any of this is wrong, it just isn’t for me personally. This is all my opinion for me personally! 

I’m not a survivor, and I’m also not a victim. I’m just someone who has been through some horrible shit. 

To me labeling myself as a survivor isn’t empowering, in fact I find that to be a bit of a trigger for me, to me, it’s giving too much power to abuser. Saying you did something SO bad I had to survive it. 

I don’t like how everything about trauma therapy for s*xual abuse (from what I’ve seen) is all about choosing to be a survivor, choosing this choosing that. Forgiveness. Etc. Non of this sits well with me. I actually find it to be putting so much on the “victim”. I didn’t choose to be this way and I can’t choose to magically be different. And I can move on and heal without forgiving horrible sadistic pedophiles and rapists. I don’t have to be the bigger person.

What I went through was horrible I don’t want to carry around a survivor label with me for the rest of my life. I didn’t choose this. I don’t have to be grateful for my abuse and I don’t have to learn from it. I’m literally just a person who’s been through crap and barely made it out alive.

This is my opinion please no “constructive criticism” or trying to change my mind.

et2t36,Both of my boyfriends have anally raped me,1b,rant,3,"I'm sorry if this is a little graphic or triggering. 

I was always curious about anal play and it turned me on a lot. When my first boyfriend and I got together, he didn't really seem interested in anal, or at least he didn't talk to me about it that I can remember. But about a year into the relationship we started exploring with it. And we did it successfully a number of times, not super painful, but very enjoyable. Later the relationship started to sour because of unmet expectations and overall lack of empathy and affection. He only wanted sex on his time and it usually wasn't convenient for me. He would stay away until 3 in the morning playing video games and after he would stop he wanted to have sex but I had to wake up at 5 to workout and get ready for school. He would be so persistent and if I said no he would get pissed and wouldn't talk to me or offer any kind of affection for days and it would be this whole fight. So I eventually just gave in and would usually just let him do it and I would pray he would finish fast. He couldn't care less if I was dry or if it would hurt. 

One day we were having sex vaginally, I was face down and he was on top of my legs. He pulled out and without warning he shoved himself in my ass and I screamed and tried to put my hands back to prevent him from going any further but he just continued until he finished. After he pulled out he walked into the bathroom like everything was normal. I continued to cry into the pillow. I think I said something to him but I don't remember what it was. Because he wouldn't have walked back into the room. He looked at me surprised like he wasn't sure why I was crying. I think I said something to the effect of ""that really fucking hurt"". Then he got angry at me and said that I was making him feel like a rapist. He never apologized for it. We broke up months later. I realize now that that relationship was abusive. That he never really cared about me and only what I could do for him. 

I moved a thousand miles away and I started this relationship with this other guy. He's perfect on paper. We have all of these similar interests, he's intelligent, kind, affectionate, dorky, and very attractive. We went camping about a month after we met and had a very good time. On the last night we drank with a couple of his friends and I got way too drunk. On and off blackout. We get back to his tent and I remember my vision was spinning and I had a really hard time climbing in. Once we got in I don't remember much. I remember laying my head down ready to go to bed. The next thing I remember is being face down and feeling pain. He put himself in my ass and was laying on top of me. I tried to say something but it felt like he was crushing my chest (I'm 120lbs and he's about 200lbs). I remember it hurting so bad and then I blacked out again. I woke up the next morning and didn't remember it at all. He asked me to be his girlfriend so I said yes. Over the next few months he was really persistent on doing butt stuff and I let him do it sometimes but it never felt good like I felt tense and I couldn't relax. It wasn't until we were with some of his friends and he was telling some story from that night that I remembered what happened. Now I'm in a relationship of 5 months with someone who doesn't know he did something awful to me. I don't know if I can bring it up to him at this point. He's moving and we're going to break up soon. But my problem is I don't know if I'll be able to have normal anal sex again. I'm afraid my body won't let it happen. That I can't trust anyone to do it with. Sorry if this was a bit long.

et2wps,"I haven't worked in nearly a year, largely due to PTSD from being raped.",1a,help-seeking,2,"I've also had anxiety and PTSD all my life. I was hospitalized twice after attempting suicide last spring because I couldn't handle the panic attacks anymore. I was starting to become a problem at work, too, just cause I was constantly terrified and didn't know how to keep it in. I've been pretty much entirely financially dependent on my parents and my best friends since then, and I've been really self-conscious about it despite my family's assurance that things were set up this way for my safety and it was OK. I've... had to deal with a lot of violence in the last several years. Rape, assault, emotional abuse, suicide attempts. And I've really only started to move past it and learn to thrive in the last half a year or so with my friends, but I'm still all too aware that this isn't sustainable. My mom called me recently and told me that I needed to either get a job soon or go on disability for the sake of our family's finances. I'll gladly do it for that reason alone, and I've also really missed having money, but work is just scary to think about considering it helped put me in a mental hospital on multiple occasions. In that sense going to work kinda feels like playing Russian roulette, if I'm honest. It's mostly just humiliating to think that my illness has made me this dependent, and that my family have had to stretch themselves this thin just to help me. They know why I'm scared and that in a perfect world I'd be able to process this stuff on my own terms. But... I've just become too expensive, and at 23 years old that really hurts to think about.

Sometimes I wonder what kind of person I would be if I hadn't been raped, or hadn't been groomed as a teenager, or assaulted even younger than that. Would I have learned to stand on my own two feet by now? Would I need this much help to get there? I know I'll be OK in the end, but... I still just wish I wasn't so high-maintenace. I hate it. It feels like my fault. How do I stop being so needy? There's just... this really angry voice inside me yelling that I've sucked my family dry and all I have to show for it is self-pity.

But I wasnt having the greatest night that night, so my attention wasnt really on the present :( A lot has brought up my trauma since xmas and I finally reported it.

I did it so right on the night. Like letting him come to me without being eager. I was like ""fuck yeah, put me on a pedestal""

We live in different cities (i'm from Sydney, he's Melbourne) so I thought I should just leave it. But somehow after that I started thinking why I didnt consider giving it a proper chance, he was complimenting me so much, could that mean something? Maybe I could like him.

I work in a music company and he's in a band I work with. I do their artwork. I heard he was coming back for a small DJ tour and I did the art. I did fucking tshirts too. And for one of the events, there was a slot for someone from my work to DJ. I was like  ""oooh this is my chance to see him again. I'll take this DJ set."" I do really want to do more DJ sets anyway so it was a good excuse.

It was about an hour away from where I live. (Wollongong) And there's another one he's doing tonight a bit closer. (south sydney)

If there wasn't the chance to DJ I would have left it. If it's not like he's contacting me to tell me he'll be close to my city, I know better than that.

I just wanted another chance to be flirty and touchy and TALK and come off more fun.

I was so worried I came off boring the morning after, and this probably proves it. **I feel like my sexual assault keeps fucking up things like this for me**. **Because that's what was going through my head in the morning.**

On the day of the Wollongong event, he came to another work event in Sydney during the day (i didnt know hed be there) and I was happy he was friendly like normal. There were  a few times where I glanced at him, and the eye contact kinda lingered. So I didnt think it was a bad thing he looked bacl/ My mind was going ""yep damn, I do still think he's cute."" 

Then I surprised him cause he didnt know I was going to DJ this event later tonight.

But when we were there, he was there with another girl. She was at the day event. I dont know if he invited he cause he saw her, or what if shes the kind of girl he DID contact to tell her he's in Sydney? Looks like he met her earlier the same month we hooked up. What if it's the second time for her, but I dont get a second time.

**Worst part, he kissed her right in front of me.**

**I feel like such a fucking idiot**. I should have just left it. These are things I KNOW. If a guy is not contacting me, I know what it means. I feel so dumb for trying this. But I wanted a chance to make a better impression.

And because that girl was doing everything I wanted to do, flirty shit, I got upset and someone told me I looked bored. And obviously i cant go near him and do the same so i was extra boring around him.

**TL;DR**: A guy I liked but was worried I might not have made a good impression on because of my clouded mind kissed someone else in front of me",anonymous_monkey2,1,0,0,2020-01-24 21:57:08,rapecounseling

etremm,A referral for counseling from Hell. Long story. Essentially a vent.,1b,help-seeking,3,"I am in The Netherlands. Here, a visit to your GP for a referral is required to go to a therapist.  The basis of my request for counseling was that I was raped in marriage repeatedly and even though I’m an ocean away and a two years removed from my abuser, I’m still having a hard time trusting or being touched even casually by men. I had told the receptionist I was having female problems (because it often is a female problem) and she assigned me to the resident in the office. 

I am a new patient to this practice. If the female resident is able to give me allergy medicine and rash cream and tell me I didn’t need a gynecological referral quite yet that she otherwise could give me, she should be able to legally write a referral. She told me this was her first one to write so she wanted to make sure she did it correctly so she was going to talk to the GP. Surely, given her excellent bedside manner, she didn’t want to traumatize me further with a poorly composed referral. If I could come back maybe tomorrow to pick it up?  Fine. I’m all for doctors learning. 

She calls me to tell me the GP needs to see me. I ask why?  She says he needs more information for the referral and as he’s never met me, he insists he needs to do so to make sure I am requesting the correct therapist, blah, blah, I smell bullshit, blah, blah. I ask her what she reported to him and how he needed more information than rape?  She’s very sympathetic but he has power over her, too. 

I called my insurance company to inquire if this was normal. They said no but we’re powerless to help. He has the power over my referrals. 

I begged the receptionist to get him to see the logic. How it is compounding trauma to make me tell a strange man, who knows I distrust men, intimate details and reminiscent of the power dynamic that traumatized me. And still, no. I promised I was angry...

His desk is next to a gynecological examination table. On his shelf sits the DSM-III, last published in 1994 and insidious for making homosexuality a disorder. (DSM-V was published in 2013...) He first gets offended that I won’t shake his hand, even though he’s been informed I’m revolted by even casual touch. Then he asks me, “so you think you were raped?” And then, “why do you think he raped you?”  “Was your sex life normal before the rapes?”  The best one was when he told a woman scared of men because she sees them as potential rapists that “you know, women get raped all the time!” I was triggered into a panic attack followed by a migraine punctuated by flashbacks. 

I got my referral. Besides the sexually inappropriate questions, He also lied to me and said he needed to make a diagnosis or insurance wouldn’t cover it. My referral letter has no such diagnosis. I had already asked what specifically needed to be included for my referral and he gets pissy that I’m telling him how to do his job. Logic and protocol says that diagnosis is not what a GP does but rather the specialist. He tells me I’m wrong and I’m in a new country and I have to trust him. When he asks why I chose a male GP, I told him the Dutch law requiring a GP in your post code limited me and for months now I’ve been trying to find anyone. You had an opening and a female resident. He told me that this not true. There are openings everywhere. I guess his usual gaslighting victims are easier prey. 

I feel abused and traumatized by my doctor. I am in a new country and alone. I have therapy intake next week, thankfully - and the Dutch amongst us will know that this is nothing short of a miracle. As I live in the Netherlands and a few doors down from a coffee shop, so basically I have smoked myself stupid all week long.  I’ve had great distracting Reddit conversations but this is the first time I’ve come here. 

And my seething anger wants me to get this doctor removed. Any Dutchies out there with ideas of how to proceed? I know I can register complaints but I mean activism. He’s not the only doctor with an egotistical God complex that is likely preventing many women from getting the help they deserve. In my case, he didn’t realize I was in the man-hating, ball-crushing stage. Or at least I was that day... maybe today, too. 

At very least I want to figure out a protocol for this. My doctor is an asshole but some well meaning doctor with zero training in rape trauma might say the wrong thing, too.  

Rape = Referral. No questions asked. It was already hard enough to say, “I’ve been raped, and I need help.”

It also made me think of Virginia Woolf: ““as a woman I have no country. As a woman I want no country. As a woman my country is the whole world.”

eu1b5i,Am I in the asshole?,0,help-seeking,3," 

A year ago, I was raped one night when my bf dropped me off at my dorm, he saw me beaten, abused and taken advantage of. Something like this has happened before so I knew what needed to be done etc, so it wasn't as traumatizing for me as it was for him. I have flashbacks, but there not of the event, there of him crying on the phone with his mom asking things like ""is there anything else I should do."" When we were at the hospital, I could tell he was trying to hide everything well, so I requested them to let me play music of my choice. I chose songs the "" A thousand years,"" ""I will always love you"" ""Nothing compares to you"" ""grow as we grow."" (This hit him hard, to the point of sheer silence, but it calmed him down so I was happy.

He then asked if I wanted to spend the night at my dorm, my parents, or his apartment. I chose his apartment. He tended to my wounds as requested when asked, And I fell asleep on him that night. and blah blas.

The next day, I decided I wanted to spend the night in my dorm, later changed my mind as I kept having flashbacks of him being traumatized that night. I then decided on my own accord to transfer university's. (I couldn't help but notice every time he would escort me to classes he always swiftly walked past the dorms. )

He saw the entire event and blames himself for it, and it drives me crazy.

He was there when I needed it the most. He did everything correctly, aside from blaming himself for how useless everyone involved was.

2 Months Later: I decided to test the waters by playing those songs in the exact order. He uhh didn't exactly respond well , and promptly changed the music. I apologized, and he said ""It's okay you didn't know.""

A few Months later, After I had settled in him if he would drive me to my old uni. He said yes, But I couldn't help but notice the fact that he walked past the dorm were it all happened extremely quickly. I realized it was to soon for him. So I decided to slow it down a ton, I waited 4 months before I started to subtly mention the topic with him, he'd always brush it off. But I can't let him hide it forever. (I admit I probably shouldn't have asked him this, as this was probs a bit much for him, were as I was 100% ready to face things head on.

A few months later during sex, I asked him if he wouldn't mind getting on top, he switched into position, and froze. From then on we pretty much we didn't do anything with him being on top, or any penetration. The closest he would ever get is making out he wouldn't mind being on top during it, it was one of the only few things he actually enjoyed, besides causal teasing during a blowjob. He used to enjoy being on top every now and then, so i figured why not. Once he got into position, he just froze. I asked if he was okay, and he said ""I'm fine, I just need a little rest."" I'm lost and I don't know what to do. I want to help him through it as he was there for me, but it's hard. And hes not really into talking about it. But I can't just let him hide everything. So I started subtly mentioning the topic going, if you have questions, or just wanna talk,cry it out. I'm here for you. In a few months we will be spending spring break at his moms, who ironically has experience in this area as she's a therapist. His mom was involved in helping him that night, Should I subtly mention the topic again in-front of his mom? And see if he's willing to talk? I don't wanna force him to something he's not ready for, But it needs to be done. :( Or did I basically wreck everything by being to quick about everything? ;( I just can't handle seeing him like this, as it reminds me of the flashbacks from when he was driving me to the hospital in the car. I know his flashbacks are of the event, as he froze when he was on top during sex. I'm lost and don't know what to do to help him through it.

Every night of my life has been triggering for me since I was a little girl, I always cried myself to sleep and became incredibly depressed and paranoid because of all the assaults I went through at night/on beds. There was a period of time where I’d wake up standing up/falling out of bed/kicking/ hyperventilating/talking etc as if I’m trying to escape from someone, because of the nightmares I’d have when I’d get to sleep...

To this day nighttime is so triggering for me. As soon as I go into my room for the rest of the night I become even more dissociative then normal and I freeze up a lot, stare off, my heart will go really fast and I’ll get paranoid. I won’t move for hours sometimes. I get so sore but the thought of moving ... well it doesn’t really even get through my mind because of how gone I am. 
This is embarrassing but I’ll just say it because no one even knows who I am. I’ll also age regress a lot, I can’t tell you how many nights I’ve spent as a little kid (2-6 yrs I think?) I feel completely like a child... I’ll watch kids cartoons and fall asleep like that .. wake up and sometimes I’m still really young. It’s hard because daily tasks are hard considering I have the mind set and knowledge of a child. I’m normally really numb and worried and scared when I go down in age but sometimes I’m complacent and feel okay. But it depends if I’m trapped in a trauma state/memory.. the experiences are quiet surreal and not exactly what I read about in ptsd age regression, they’re almost more separate from myself, if that makes sense. But anyways..

I just need some help with being able to function at night. It’s so triggering for me, i know I’m safe logically but cptsd brain won’t let me believe it.

euswtx,"I talk to confront my trauma, is it appropriate to talk to my partner about it this much?",1b,help-seeking,2,"For context, I’ve found that I am currently in a cycle of grieving where I will be fine with my past for about a week and a half, and then I will feel anger or self-loathing creep up on me and I will need to talk it out with someone for a few minutes or write about it somewhere. If I don’t, I hold onto it and it eats at me for 3-4 days.

I was coerced into rigging situations and slave roleplay for 2 years with my ex. I wanted to have sex with him, but not that kind. I did not want to speak up for fear of losing him; we broke up in March 2018 and I met my current partner in June. I am happier and healthier now than I have ever been, and I can’t wait to see what our future holds.

My current partner has explained previously that he hated when I brought up my trauma because the image of my ex inflicting these acts on me sickened him, and made him too angry to be able to support me when I have brought previous experiences up to him. I stopped when he asked me to because I honestly didn’t know it was making him uncomfortable.

Recently, he asked me about something I chose to post about on a social account in lieu of talking to him, because that’s a void for me to shout into, like a journal. I answered him honestly, and I told him I was surprised he’d asked, though it made me feel better knowing that he’d reached out to me about it. He then pressed me to explain why I talked about it, and this is what I’ve said:

I talk about my experience to grieve and acknowledge it, so that I can move on. I don’t forget it, as I haven’t forgotten the horrific torment I experienced in grade school for my sexuality; I can be at peace and not forget these things. I tried to bring up my sexual trauma with him because I felt safe, I felt like I could trust him, and when he said that he couldn’t talk about it and got angry with me, I stopped because I respected that; it was a boundary I wouldn’t cross again. I talk about my experiences to compartmentalize them, to find myself again, to find reason to validate that I was not wrong, that I was not sick and disgusting and deserving of the treatment I received.

He then said that if I needed to talk to him about it I could bring up my trauma to him. I don’t know that I’ll need to for a long time, as I feel I am in a better place with it now than I was several weeks ago. I just...don’t know that it’s appropriate for me to talk to him about it, his previous boundary considered. What is my responsibility here? I feel like I should just talk to a therapist and not air it elsewhere.",onlytoadpout,1,0,1,2020-01-27 19:26:33,rapecounseling
ev0fpl,Angry,1b,rant,1,"I'm so angry at everyone around me, but mostly at my family. They just don't understand, I had left this behind me. I was okay with myself, living my best life before -this- all happened. They think this is some easy process. That once I give a simple statement, that's it. I'm done with all of this. But I was done a long time ago.

I had put my memories and hatred in a box, dug a hole, put the box in the hole, covered it and planted a tree over it. Now they want me to bring it all back up, like it's some easy thing for me to do. That this will be soo much easier after this. Maybe for them, but this, bringing it up, ruining someone's life (although they ruined their own), going through the questions and being forced to bring up old memories, makes me so angry. 

Of course they wouldn't get it, because they have no idea what this feels like. I had already forgiven and moved on. Ugh! Don't they understand that this isn't helping me! Before this whole situation happened, I was happy. Better off before they threw me into this.

ev0v17,My story (rape/SA) trigger warning,1a,help-seeking,2,"Ok so I don’t know exactly how to write this out. Sharing my story is really weird and hard for me. I still have days where I wonder if it really happened. I have days where I blame myself. I also have days where I’m fully able to process what happened and then I fall off the wagon mentally and take a while to return to my normal self.

  My story all started on the date of November 2, 2018. I had been getting messages from a previous coworker I had been acquaintances with for about a year. He was an average, 31 year old, African American, tatted, chill dude. I always thought he was cool just from the way he was. I knew his girlfriend and I was always really attracted to her. Let me remind you, I was 19 at the time.
   Anyway, he was messaging me, asking when we could chill. I used to hang out with a lot of people his age from the same place we worked at so I thought nothing of it. After reading the message, I put some thought into it. What could go wrong??? He’s cool, I’ll invite a friend with me, we’ll vibe, and then that’ll be it.....
  Boy, I was so wrong......
So me and my friend (my best friends boyfriend) tagged along to his place. The guy (we’ll call him Bryce) had a whole bottle of some dark liquor. We all drank together. Me and my friend were drunk, but not overly intoxicated. Just drunk enough to feel good but still be able to control ourselves. All the sudden I got really fucked up and everything got blurry. I didn’t remember much of what happened later that night. I remember my friend was out of sight, Bryce had carried me into his room, my pants were off, and then he was having sex with me. I recall some other stuff happening like me saying no. It was over soon. I don’t remember falling asleep.

   November 3, 2018
This was the most traumatizing thing I’d ever gone through in my life.
  I woke up the next morning and Bryce was touching me. I kept repeating “no” and that I “just wanted to sleep” over and over again. He didn’t stop and I started to panic. I moved away from him and I felt temporarily safe but I was frozen. I could not move at all. About 2 minutes later he put his dick in me and started having sex with me. I dissociated really bad. I remember saying “no” a lot but quietly. I couldn’t fight or scream or move at all. It was over after what felt like eternity but was probably only 10 mins. When he was done he told me that I told him to do that the night before and that I wanted it. I’m still in shock. I can’t process any of this. If anyone can please help me understand this...pls. I’m at such a loss. It was traumatic but I feel like it was all my fault.",speghetti_confetti,1,0,1,2020-01-28 4:58:15,rapecounseling
ev1we3,Just found out my rapist died,1b,rant,2,"I was raped 20 years ago. I knew him. I had ran away from my parents house to live with him. He ended up being very abusive and controlling. I was still a virgin and he took that from me without consent. I ended up pregnant and had an abortion. This is just the short version of all that. Anyways, I usually keep tabs on my rapist by stalking his Facebook page. I don’t use my real name on mine because of him and me just being anxious in general. I usually check his page once a month. I hadn’t checked his since before thanksgiving so I was surprised to see it as a memorial page today. He had committed suicide. I was shocked. I quickly found his obituary. He had 4 kids. 2 he had when I knew him. One another girl (who was a minor) was pregnant with when I was still living at his house (I had no where to go). I have struggled with mental illness my whole life. I understand feeling suicidal. Part of me feels incredibly sad he did that. Another part of me is relieved I don’t have to worry about seeing him or running into him. Another part is furious I never confronted him with my hurt and anger. That he didn’t know my whole life changed and I became fearful of everything. I never reported him because I didn’t think anyone would believe me since I have a mental illness. I just feel a mess of emotions and I don’t know how to sort through it. I feel awful. I didn’t know where else I could share this where someone might understand

ev2e7v,I've been living with unattended trauma for the past 6 years,1a,rant,2,"Six years ago, I had a friend whom I had a crush on. We were both 16. He knew I liked him and he took advantage of that. I didn't want him to touch me but I let him because I thought he would like me back. I was so naive and unlearned. I blame myself for it because now the question of consent is in a grey area. I said no at first but then I would say yes. I wouldn't want it but my body loved it. And I let this go on for months. 

I had no one to confide in for the past six years because I was scared being ridiculed by my peers. I couldn't trust my family. I had no money or time for a therapist. I was all alone. Now I'm 21, still reminded of him at least a few times a month. He comes to me in my dreams and I wake up longing for his touch when I know it's wrong. I hate him yet I want him.

I have a boyfriend who loves and cares for me now but he just doesn't understand this weird internal struggle I'm going through.

ev3l7m,17 years and I can’t stop having nightmares,1b,help-seeking,1,"I (34f) was in a 17 year relationship where my partner (34m) would hurt me every time we had sex.

During the relationship it made me uncomfortable but it wasn’t until I had space from it and different partners did I realize just how bad it really was.

I was abused when I was extremely young so sex was never something extremely pleasant for me. The few other experiences I had before my partner were uncomfortable for different reasons.

I am having problems sleeping without nightmares. I have tried different sleep meds but nothing works without side effects. I am so exhausted that I am feeling at the end of my rope.

ev439b,Help with moving on,1b,help-seeking,2,"I was in a relationship a few years ago and I was raped multiple times by my ex while we were together.... it was a manipulative type of situation where if I said no he would cry or just keep trying to make me get in the mood.. I remember one time calling him out on it by saying “what you just did to me was technically rape” and he said “yah” 
My heart sank. 

Fast forward a few years later I am in love with a man who knows all of what happened, at least the majority. He is the most supportive and most wonderful person when it comes to considering my feelings when it comes to intimacy. When I ask for space he immediately backs away and gives it to me and he is very patient with me when I have mood swings. 

When he and I started dating everything was normal, we were sexually active and it was fun. (This was only months after I has left my ex who raped me) When I began opening up to him more about my past relationship (which was with his bestfriend btw - no longer) we stopped having as much sex because it seemed to be that when we began the act I would start talking about my past and He would end up comforting me while I cried.
It got to the point where now when we try to have sex everything is okay until actual... penetration.. I immediately start crying. I can’t really explain it.. it is like a burst of sudden emotion and  cannot control it. we have tried again a few times but have since stopped.

And that is the problem. I love him so much, and I want to be able to sleep with him like a normal couple should. But it seems it has gotten to the point where we don’t even kiss in fear of me getting upset. I miss being close to him in that way but I am just afraid.

So I am asking you all if you have any advice on baby steps to get back to that, or how to cope with the rape. I feel like I never gave myself a chance to really process those emotions in a healthy way and now I am broken. 

Any advice?",pandajiz,1,0,1,2020-01-28 10:54:32,rapecounseling
ev9i83,PTSD,1a,help-seeking,1," I'm wondering how others handle flash backs, nightmares and fleeting feelings of being back in the situation. Do they go away with time or are they going to be with me forever? 

I was unconscious when I was raped but awoke in the middle of it happening and was able to kick him off of me and get away into my apartment building  to find help. My life was taken from me that night, my whole life. S.O. left me and took our daughter. I was left homeless and alone. It was the trauma of rape and everything that came after that still haunts me. Sometimes I just ""disappear"" and find myself flooded with the emotions I had running from him that night, the physical pain, 'waking' to realize I was being raped, the desperation I felt when I tried to find help and the unbearable pain of everything I lost. It can knock me on my ass when it happens and it can happen whenever or wherever. It's been over 2 years. 

I have a trial date for this September and am terrified that things are going to get worse when I have to relive it all again.

He slows down and asks if he should stop, and he stops and asks why I'm doing that. I tell him I'm not sure why but it hurts but I dont know why. But since we stopped for a little I'm ok and we can keep going.


 So the next time this happened again, when it hurt, I automatically did the same thing.. I tried to push him away, and I actually tried moving away myself. But this time he pushes my arms away so I cant push him away anymore and he lays on top of me, closing the gap, with his body on me, and he says ""Just take it"".

The other weekend, my niece (by marriage) came out about how she had been raped. It had become a discussion between her, a friend, and myself, trying to give support since all 3 of us had been in this situation. But I couldn't get myself to tell my story. I somehow felt like it was wrong to talk about it (hmmm wonder why?) and I began thinking how absolutely fucked up the entire situation was. I've never noticed it before, but my uncle, the Golden Child who was seemingly the favorite at least in my adult life, had raped me and no one even thinks about this. When my father passed, everyone was worried about how I'd handle it and everyone overlooked my uncle. Grandma always felt so bad about that. But here I am today, reliving this because it was brought up in conversation but it's like it never happened??? I'm so angry and feel so broken because my rape was ignored.

exbtee,"Memories I have of my dad, what were they? Were they inappropriate?",1b,help-seeking,2,"(TW) I’m so nervous to make this post. I know I’m probably just hyper aware due to my past s*xual abuse. as It was done by many people over the span of 12 yrs. But anyways..
I’ve always had a couple memories that tripped me out a bit. I don’t think it’s abuse but I’m worried sometimes it was something more then I thought. I know what s*xual abuse is, I know what r*pe is, I’ve been through all of it many times. Maybe this was covert s*xual abuse?

When I was a kid me and my dad would go swimming at the pool at weekends he’d have me and my sister. We’d always change in the family changing rooms, there were big private stalls with locks and with private showers and us three would all go in one together, obviously so we were safe, I know that, but the thing is, I hated being naked, I always have, I don’t like being nude in front of other people, there was a dip in the wall where the wall came out and the shower was there and I could change without my dad and sister seeing me, I was 8-9 I think by then I deserved privacy. My dad got mad one time and told me I should be comfortable enough to change RIGHT in front of him and my sister but I said no, he forced me to look at him completely nude and kept saying “just look at it, come on, what’s ur problem?” (Meaning look at his private parts) he came up really close and was laughing but also annoyed/mad, he cornered me and made me really uncomfortable. he made me change in front of him and my sister and I hated it. He forced me to look at me him nude. Naked men really triggered me and I’ve never heard of dads doing this before being normal. He would also not respect my privacy when it came to nudity in general. He had a glass shower door at one point and would make me shower with the door open sometimes so he and my sister could use the bathroom whenever. My sister would always stare at me and make me uncomfortable, she was obsessed with my naked body growing up and even went as far as hiding a camera in the bathroom to film me naked. 

I feel like this just isn’t normal but I also know it’s not s*xual abuse. I just can’t see why a grown man would force his daughter to look at him naked especially his private parts. and then change in front of him when I could have walked a couple feet to the side and have my privacy.

I’ve told someone this before and they got mad saying I was being ridiculous and he was just keeping me safe but I don’t know how that’s keeping me safe. I WAS safe. I was in a locked stall. I just don’t get it. It really bothers me sometimes because of my past abuse. It makes no not trust him..

If this is nothing lmk but please don’t be rude about it... I’ve only ever told one person it’s not like I’m trying to make abuse up like that person made me feel. I already have enough abuse. It’s just a uncomfortable inappropriate situation that I think about sometimes...",risingsouls7,1,0,1,2020-02-01 20:09:30,rapecounseling

exdh6g,Advice for starting,1b,help-seeking,2,"Potential trigger warning, I gave some vague details about my trauma. Not sure if it's considered triggering, but just wanted to give anyone reading a heads up. I'm new to this sub. 

Hi everyone, I've been skimming around and really appreciate some of the love and support you all give. A few weeks ago I told my therapist about my past experiences and how they affect me. Without going into details, I was coerced at a young age to have multiple, repeated sexual encounters with someone who was not an adult but significantly older than me. I've never known what to call it because it's a grey area (to me) and I'm not sure what to call it. My boyfriend says I was groomed but I'm not sure if I don't agree or am in denial about it. 

Lately, a lot of stuff has been kind of numb to me. Since I started talking about it, I've been having intense moments of depression, I've been angry in situations that I'm normally not, and I just want to give up on treatment (which I've never done in my three years of therapy). I'm not sure if this is a response to talking about my trauma or if others have felt this? I've been to group therapy, before, but I'm really not interested in going to a group about all of this. It seems really intimidating so I figured I'd come here.

I just want to know what everyone's experiences were as they first began to talk about their trauma was like. There's a lot of things that trigger me but I haven't figured out how to handle them or identify them. My therapist is still really early in working with me on this and I'm a little reluctant to share (verbally) so some sessions I feel like I'm the roadblock. 

Any information is appreciated. Thanks for you time :)",JoshuaXSantiago,1,0,5,2020-02-01 22:08:19,rapecounseling
exk5fa,men vs finding out i was raped,1b,rant,3,"i fucking HATE more than anything else in the world how men react when i disclose my rape to them. with women there's usually this mutual understanding, often they have stories of being sexually harassed themselves or even raped. i rarely find this the case with men.

women usually tell me 'i'm sorry that happened to you' without any expectation that i'll go deeper into the details, or any assumption of what those details might be. men tend to look very uncomfortable, followed by telling me they'd never do anything like that (like fucking OBVIOUSLY i don't think you would otherwise i wouldn't be disclosing this to you). i've only ever been asked to describe what happened by men (one of which i later found out had described my rape to his friend and masturbated over it) and i've found men tend to assume what happened more than women.

i've also only had men give me 'suggestions' on how to make myself less rapeable. the guy that inspired this post looked at my post history while responding to a different post of mine on a totally different sub and decided it was a good idea to message me suggesting i take self defence classes.

like being able to put someone in a headlock would've prevented me from being raped while i was passed out and high in my VERY CLOSE FRIEND'S bed. like the onus is on ME to PREVENT myself getting raped, not on my fucking RAPIST for being an oxygen wasting piece of human excrement. 

and then when i say i was high and passed out suddenly it gets very 'well you should only do drugs with people you trust'. I DID. THATS WHY I WAS SLEEPING ON HIS BED. the irony is it's always fucking potheads who judge me for getting raped while high, like don't tell me i shouldn't have been smoking weed when you light up a bong every goddamn night you hypocritical knob jockey.

i'm very open about telling people i was sexually assaulted because i am well past feeling ashamed and as if it was my fault, if it's relevant i have no issue talking about it. so i have had many different reactions and some perfectly sane reactions from men and utterly ridiculous ones from women (like my mother who, despite being a rape victim herself, slut shamed me). but i'm really quite sick and fucking tired of men telling me it wasn't their fault (which i goddamn know) and trying to imply i should have done something 'better' or 'different'. yes, it wouldn't have happened if i hadn't have done what i did but he was the active participant in the scenario and he should not have done that to me, i don't really care if i 'caused it'.

also not trying to erase male victims of rape, i'm very sympathetic to them, but it seems to me like literally every woman has been made to feel unsafe by a man and therefore they're way more empathetic than the majority of men.",definitelynotabby,1,0,30,2020-02-02 6:12:59,rapecounseling

eynxi4,Does it have to define my identity?,0,help-seeking,2,"I have finally admitted to myself that I was raped at least once, but probably twice. The first time was ten years ago when I was a teenager. In my head, I called it “bad sex” or “a stupid decision”, but it was more than that and I think I always knew on some level. One thing I always knew for sure is that I was traumatized by it. 

The second time happened recently and it was definitely rape. It was so hard for me to admit it to myself because I guess I thought it meant that the first time was rape too and I didn’t want to deal with that. I didn’t want to be a victim. But I AM a rape victim, and denying it will not be healthy.

My question for everyone is, what does it mean to you to be a victim/survivor (to me, it doesn’t really matter what I call it, it feels the same)? Is it an important part of who you are? Now that I have finally come to terms with it, it feels like it is this huge thing that has to change how I see myself. I always thought of myself as someone who has had a “normal” life (pretty normal at least), but suddenly I have to see myself as someone who went through something terrible that other people can’t relate to. And I hate that.

When I was younger, I had some mental health issues, but I got better, and I think it has a lot to do with me not wanting to be “weak” and a victim. I have been trying to put all of my issues behind me and strive to do good in life, and I really want to show people I am in control, so admitting what happened to me has been difficult. 

By the way, I think some of my mental health issues might have been caused by the first rape even though I never told anyone about it. I just didn’t think it was important. I was in denial for so long.",Still_confused88,1,0,12,2020-02-04 10:07:16,rapecounseling

eyvb57,Finally starting to process,1b,help-seeking,3,"Hi all. This happened to me 5 months ago and I'm starting to feel ready to process it. I'm definitely in the category of folks who think it ""wasn't that bad"" and have been coping fine, so have a hard time admitting that something bad happened. I haven't told anyone yet.

I (23F) had been seeing this guy (25M) for a couple months and it was getting kind of serious. He's the typical Nice Guy (TM) with twisted ideas of how men and women should interact, but especially good at making them sound reasonable.

We'd had a lot of consensual sex the day before, and I was feeling very sore and tired and just ready to take a break. We had already had sex once that morning and I was hurting and done. He was spooning me and went to enter me again. I said no and pushed myself away from him. He pulled me back and entered me anyway.

I told myself it would stop hurting in a few seconds (you know when you're sore, but you want to have sex anyway and it burns for a few seconds but then starts feeling good again? That's what I decided was happening.), so I waited. It stopped hurting and I came, and then it started hurting worse than before. I waited for a bit to see if it stopped hurting. It didn't. We had previously established a safe word, so I said it. He slowed down and asked if I was okay, and I said no and he stopped.

Later in the day, I confronted him about it. He was surprised that I was serious when I told him no. He said that most women don't mean it when they say no. He said that he did it anyway, and I came, so I liked it. I spent the next 20 minutes begging him to reassure me that when I said no in the future, he would listen. He said it would take him a while to adjust.

Unsurprising to everyone, I'm sure, but this wasn't his only scary/manipulative behavior. I recognized enough of them to leave shortly after this happened.

I don't want to report him. There's no proof, and he has friends in the police force. When we broke up he told his friends that I cheated on him and went crazy. I have a lot of guilt about leaving him out in the world to hurt other women.

I feel very lucky to have friends that would believe and support me if I told them what happened. But I feel like I used up a lot of their understanding and wisdom and strength already to help me get away from him. I feel like it's been too long, we've moved on from talking about him, and I'm doing fine so I don't need to bring it up again. My closest friends have sexual/emotional abuse stories that are worse than mine, and I don't want to remind them of their trauma just so I can talk about this.

I recently started seeing a new partner, and I've been having trouble opening up to him about my sexual history or my traumas, not just this. I'm concerned that this trauma is keeping me from trusting this new partner, who is a long time friend and by all accounts trustworthy and kind. I want him to know what happened to me, but every time I walk through what I would say to him in my head I just feel emotionally exhausted.

I really have been doing fine. I used one-night stands after this happened to begin recovering my autonomy (I'm not here to debate whether or not this was a good coping mechanism. Please don't criticize this right now, that's a conversation for another time). I think that worked pretty well for me. I've continued with my daily life and work as usual, and I've been able to enjoy sex with my new partner. I'm just having a very very hard time allowing myself to be emotionally vulnerable with him. I never had so much trouble with that before this happened.

Has anyone here had a similar experience? I haven't decided how I want to label it. I don't know whether or not it matters what I call it.

So the first time my ex raped me I didn’t realize it was actually rape. He kept trying to have sex with me after I smoked a bunch of weed and could barely stay awake, I grabbed his wrist at one point shoved it away and yelled no stop it I don’t to, then he pinned me down and forcefully have sex with me, I looked away the whole time and gave up fighting after a while. When he was done he kissed me gently and rolled over and went to sleep. I fell off the bed after I was let go and put my clothes back on and left his house and caught the bus home. After this we never talked about it and I didn’t like having sex with him. But he’d still make me. We’d be lying down and he’d just start doing it and I wouldn’t move or say anything, I’d just let him. I was so scared. This happened more times then I can count. Normally though I’d say no, get off, and he’d do it anyways and I’d just give up, it felt horrible and disgusting but he’d tell me my body was his so he was aloud to do this. He confessed to being addicted to raping me once. 


Sometimes I’d run out of the house and he’d chase me down the street and grab me and force me back in the house and I’d be so scared at that point because even if I screamed no one cared, he’d have sex with me and once again I wouldn’t say anything apart for no a couple times. He was so scary. I couldn’t leave so I felt like I didn’t have a choice. I did fight back and was physically forced a lot though too...idk...
But is it rape if I just don’t say anything and just lay there unresponsive or say no but then give up and “let” it happen? Or say no but then after struggling for a couple minutes just freeze and not do anything? I tried to leave so many times and it always ended horrible. Cops even took his side the one time they were involved. 


I feel like I don’t have the right to call this rape. I told a therapist once that I couldn’t leave my abusive ex and she laughed and said “why it’s not like you were married?”

ezc977,A letter to my rapist,1b,rant,2,"**if this isn’t allowed or goes against any rules please delete it** 

You raped me when I was 14. Except, it didn’t feel like rape. Not at all. One of my biggest regrets of that night is not being good for you. Why do I want to be good for you? You raped me. Except it didn’t feel like rape. My mind was in conflict with itself. Part of me was like ‘hey, you’re losing your virginity. This is good experience’. And the other part of me was saying ‘wrong. This is wrong. You gotta stop this. It’s illegal and wrong’. Unfortunately, my morals won that night. But not completely because I kissed you back as you were making me promise not to tell anyone. I broke that promise. I feel so guilty for breaking that promise. You didn’t rape me. It didn’t feel like rape. It felt like sex. But not good sex because I was scared. Not of you, just of sex in general because I was 14 and it was my first time. It’s okay because you talked me through it. You were nice like that. And that’s what fucked with me the most. You were so patient, so gentle with me. You even ate me out. It felt great. And after everything, when I finally said ‘stop’, you stopped. For that reason, I don’t feel like I was raped. I wish I was raped. Maybe it would have been easier. Maybe I could hate you like everyone else hates their rapist. Maybe I wouldn’t be writing this letter. Maybe I wouldn’t be defending you every time someone tells me you’re a bad person. You could have hurt me. You could have played out your fantasies perfectly. But you didn’t. And that’s why I don’t believe you’re a bad person. I felt so guilty putting you in prison because even though you have sick, twisted fantasies, you never actually hurt anyone. Except me. You didn’t hurt me. Maybe you never would have hurt anybody. But now we’ll never know. People always tell me “He hurt you, that’s enough”, but he didn’t hurt me. I don’t feel hurt. “He has a journal filled with horrible fantasies!”. Okay? It’s good he has a journal. That means he’s expressing himself in a healthy way. Having fantasies doesn’t make someone a bad person. I have fantasies. Everyone has probably fantasized about something bad sometime in their life. I fantasize about meeting you again, and telling you all of this in person. But you’re in prison for life. Because of me. And there’s no way I’m spilling all of this in a recorded room. So this letter will have to do. I fantasize about you breaking out of prison and coming to see me. I don’t know why you came to see me. I hoped it was to see me. I wanted to go with you. I don’t know why I want to go with you. I don’t know why I want to be good for you. I fantasize about us living together. I ask “Am I too old for you now?” and hope the answer is no. Why do I want to be with you? Maybe to ease my guilty conscience. Maybe this is a weird version of stockholm syndrome. Maybe because we’re the same. You were my favourite uncle. And surprisingly, you still are. (Don’t tell your brother I said that). We had a connection. When your mom would tell me stories about you as a child, I could really relate to everything she said. Am I going to turn out like you? That’s one of my biggest fears. I want to talk to you. I’ve wanted to talk to you for 10 years, ever since I put you away. What would I say? “I’m sorry for sending you to prison, how are you doing? I hope you didn’t get raped for being a child molester”. Oh god. What if he got raped? I don’t want him to get raped. I wish I was raped. Uncle? Do you think about me as much as I think about you? Probably not. To you, I was probably just a risky fuck. But to me, you’re my world. I think about you almost every night. Uncle...? Why didn’t you rape me? I wish you would have raped me. 

Please no negative comments. I know saying ‘I wish I was raped’ is a loaded statement. I was raped. I was 14, he was in his late 30s. He is my uncle. It was rape. But it doesn’t feel like rape. Lots of rape victims tell me I was lucky or I had it easy because he didn’t hurt me but the emotional turmoil doesn’t feel easy.

ezjtre,My [M/39] sister [F/44] visited my cousin [M/48] who gave me unwanted sexual touching when I was a child. I'm feeling bad about it. Do I overact ?,1b,help-seeking,2," Hey guys,

First of all, I would like to apologize for my English and any misunderstanding I could bring.

When I was young \[8/10\], I was sleeping with my cousin \[15/17\]. And he asked me to masturbate his penis. It's pretty nothing, but it became kind of a nightmare during a long period of time.

Until I was 26, I didn't really realize it was bad, and I was not completely conscious about it. My mind was broken. After a specific event , everything came back to my conscious. There I moved to an other country. I worked in alcohol industry, became alcoholic, took drug : my life looked hell. I did a therapy between 2014 and 2015.

In 2014, we had an other terrific event. My sister's son \[10\] has been raped by an other cousin \[13\]. He was taken really quickly by a specialist, and police. When she told me this story, I told her briefly about my experience, but I didn't say who did that. She kept mainly quiet. When I came back to my house, I wrote a long letter about my nephew's bad experience, and how we can help him. But she just replied with a picture of me and my niece. I felt kind of alone.

Anyway, my life was not going that great, and I felt kind of alone and depressed. Well, you know. And I decided to come back to my country. I always had issues with my sex life. It's the reason why, I said the story to my mum in October 2018. I thought that could have helped me. It was the hardest moment of my life, and my mother was really really supportive. Thank God ! And I told who did that to me. I have never talked about it with her since. At this moment, I called my sister, and I told her it was my cousin. But she didn't say anything really. Just she kind of joke about the men she thought who did it to me. She was really distant. But she also mentioned a strange story about my uncle when he was 13, he was rubbing, fully clothed, against her, she was 8 I think. But she didn't so too much.

This year she visited my aunt with my father (who doesn't anything about this story), and after she went to my cousin house. She was really closed to him when she was a teenager, they were always going out together, and the first bf she had was his best friend.

When they came back, my father came to my house and talked about his weekend, and he told me they went to visit my cousin. When I heard it, I dissociated straight away. It felt strange as it was the first time I could feel it, and I could kind of control it. But it definitely hurt.

Also tonight Finally, I have discovered they are now friends together on Facebook.

Lately, I have really difficult relationship with my sister. I renamed her contact ""Negative Energy"". She is a really good person, clever and successful. But the relationship with me is really awkward. Having done this label helped me when my father gave me the information. I had enough distance that the dissociation was not too strong. Thankfully.

I have to be honest with you : I feel all of this really strange and I don't know why I'm writing this message. But I just feel bad. I have been thinking of this since Monday (when I got the news). I can't sleep. It's 1.00am, and I have to wake up at 5.30am.

I had terrible anger yesterday. I wanted to disavow her. I give Skype tutoring to my nephew and my niece, and she pays me for this. We have common holidays in April. And my nephews have parties in June and I am invited. I just want to say fuck off to all of this. I don't want to see her, I don't want to meet her, I don't wan't to fight. I just want to run. I think I should not have talked about this experience to her, as she had already her issues with her son, and I should have just keep quiet. In any manner, talking to her hasn't helped me. I don't feel it at all. Now, I just feel she can contact with him, and if I was not here, she could be more relax. In April 2019, we went to visit my aunt, and my cousin was there. When I arrived to my aunt's house, my mother was already there. She was panicking. So we all went to a cafe waiting he was leaving. But I felt my sister was not really concerned. My father doesn't know, and my other sister doesn't too. I definitely feel strongly, if I was not here or I didn't say anything, they could have enjoyed a really good time. He's an alpha male, really funny and sympathetic man.

I feel like I am a shy man, I complain a lot, and I could put myself as a victim, but I feel like I have never talked a lot about this story to some people. More recently, in the last 4 years, I talked to my gfs and to some of my friends, but I stopped as I think I have hurt them, or they didn't feel concern, or they thought I was overacting.

I feel like I am kind of a ""drama king"", and finally this is not so much, and I am ashamed to talk about this, because that happened once, and only 5 minutes. But it really hurt deeply and strongly. Generally speaking, I really feel better than I used to do. I still could have some PTSD or suicidal thoughts, but it's definitely really better.

I am completely lost and crazy. I think I just need some advice.

Thank you for reading and I'm sorry about it.

ezmdwz,Twice and I'm only 18 .,1b,rant,2,"I don't care if I'm just screaming into the void; I just need to talk about it. 

When I was 15, I was assaulted by someone who I thought was my friend, in my home. He was 18 at the time and was one of the best hockey players in the state. I couldn't say no. I wanted to, but the words wouldn't come out of my mouth. I blamed myself so much for it, even though I rationally knew it wasn't my fault. I have been able to look myself in the mirror for almost 3 years now. I haven't felt pretty since that night. I learned to cope through nicotine, alcohol, and eventually sex. I hate that I have to use boys to validate myself.

About a month ago, I went over to this boy's house. We had been on a date a couple months earlier and I thought he was really nice. We hadn't ever been on a second date because we live 30 minutes a part and we are both very busy. Nonetheless, I thought he was a good guy. 

I went over to his house knowing what he wanted, but I changed my mind. I told him I didn't want to have sex but I was okay with fooling around a little bit. At this point, I'm practically naked in his bed. He then tries to penetrate me. I tell him that I said no. He tries again. And again. And again. I kept telling him that I said **no.** I was trying to push him off me but he still kept trying. He did eventually give up, but he still had hurt me. I feel guilty because I went over knowing what he wanted and was doing other things with him, but I still made it very clear that I didn't want to have sex. Now I'm traumatized all over again.

Toward the end of our relationship he allowed another man to rape me. (I'm honestly still on the fence about saying it was outright rape, mostly just because that's a hefty accusation to levy and I allowed myself to be in that situation). But he talked me into having a threesome and held my wrists down as the other guy had anal intercourse with me. It hurt. A lot. And I screamed. But I never said no, or stop, or anything like that. I just stared at his hands on my wrists. And almost as soon as it was done I wiped it from my memory. It wasn't until I was telling my mom about all the small, vague occurrences that I had a sudden flashback and I was right there again, staring at my wrists. I can hear their voices still (this happened in September). I strongly feel that this was at least assault. 

But there are other things about my sexual history with my ex I'm struggling to define. He was my first relationship. He would do things like touch me in public, overzealously 'cuddle' even when I said no, coerce me to perform sexually at friends and family's houses, and often times I would wake up to him on top of me, already fucking me. One time he even split me open to the point I was bleeding and it hurt to sit. Eventually, I started losing memory from times when I was drowsy or tipsy, or asleep. It all seemed so normal.

i had a regular pap last week , which was horrible. and now i have to go in for a procedure tomorrow and possible biopsy . So i am terrified of both what they might find ... hopefully nothing and also the procedure itself. i have asked to prescribe me something to relax me so it isn’t as bad and i don’t want to have to tell her to stop and prolong the appointment or not figuring out what’s going on down there. i just want it over with but i’m terrified. i hope this isn’t triggering for anyone or anything and i really just wanted somewhere to talk where people might understand. thank you for reading this far.",Rosebud_xx,1,0,4,2020-02-06 20:45:58,rapecounseling

f023ta,Got into a toxic relationship after being raped,1b,rant,2,"I was raped by my manager at work, and straight after I started sleeping around in order to try and drown the experience as much as I could. During this period I met a guy also from my work who I got in an on and off relationship with. He treated me like absolute shit, always letting me make all the effort, saying shit that was downright cruel and breaking up with me whenever I got bored. 

I think I was always his backup plan for women, but because there were times he had comforted me during everything, and I felt safe when I had sex with him I always let him walk all over me. I think this is partly due to the fact that he could be incredibly manipulative. Recently, after he stood me up on my birthday and ignored me for ages, he called me to tell me that he slept with my best friend from awhile back. 

The thing I’m most pissed about is I allowed someone so sleazy and cruel as a human being to completely treat me like trash just so I would have some comfort during panic attacks and such. Even when I had other friends that I could go to, I would always choose to call him and want him to make me feel okay. I realise now how stupid I’ve been, but I also don’t know how to not associate everything with him. I’ve cut off all contact with him now, but I’m worried that I’ll just try and reach out again like I always do, even though I know he’s not good for me. 


The reason I’m posting this here is because I associate him with the period during which I was raped so much, and I don’t know how to stop that. Everything feels all so confusing, I suppose because he was the only one who stuck by me during that period (which isn’t even true completely, yet I’m still that desperate) while everyone else either found it too difficult to deal with or didn’t believe me.

f07xs3,Anxious about dating again,1b,rant,2,"I am unsure if men are allowed to post here, I’m sorry if this is the case... I’m afraid of being made fun of but I need to get this off my chest. I just feel deeply ashamed of the way I lost my virginity. 

I was only 15. I met a girl (17) through social media and after only a few days of messaging she asked if I wanted to be in a relationship. As someone who was bullied, had low self esteem and had never been in a relationship I accepted ecstatically. After the honey moon phase of the relationship things started to go downhill quickly. I realized she was very manipulative and would scream at me if I chose to spend time with my family over being on the phone with her. I was also suicidal at this point in time and would usually console in her when I thought about offing myself only to be met with responses like “You’re just selfish” instead of comfort. I chalked this mistreatment down to tension from being unable to see each other in person. Out of desperation to keep the relationship going I took the blame for almost everything. After dating for about a year and a half my grandparents drove me up to see her in Indiana for prom (I live in North Carolina, so it was a good 11 hour drive).

I am transgender and had said that I didn’t want to  have any physical relations until I was 18 and had had a mastectomy. In response to this she purposefully made me feel like if I didn’t let her touch me then I wasn’t a real man. I was incredibly uncomfortable with the idea of being penetrated but she did it anyway. I remember it hurting, and that it was made 10x worse by the fact that I happened to be having my menstrual cycle. She also made me take off my shirt, touched my breasts and degraded me for things that made me super dysphoric, like my height (I’m 5’2 she was 5’7). I faked an orgasm because I so badly wanted it to be over with. After she fell asleep, I went and took an hour long shower in an attempt to feel not so dirty. I also cried and ate half a cake. About a month after that encounter I finally grew a backbone a broke it off. 

I still feel like garbage. The thought of dating again gives me anxiety, and I shower constantly because I can’t ever stop feeling disgusting. She made me feel like I was a girl, she mocked my deteriorating mental health and she took advantage of me.",Allons-Yeet,1,0,1,2020-02-07 8:59:22,rapecounseling

f17b44,I was sexually assaulted as a young boy (triggers).,1b,rant,1,When I was 11 years old my neighbor across the street was in her early fifties. She asked me to come over and fix her computer (early days of PC’s) and I agreed. While I was fixing her computer she wakes into the bedroom and called me inside. As soon as I got to the open doorway my stomach flipped and I nearly turned to stone. She was bent over the bed with her pants and underwear off spreading her ass open with both hands. She told me to “start licking” or else she’d tell my parents that I broke her computer. I’ve never told anyone this but I’m 35 years old and almost every day I think about that fact that I tasted this grown woman’s hairy asshole as a kid and it makes me feel sick.,Evil_Empire27,1,0,0,2020-02-09 11:08:29,rapecounseling
f1od6h,Sometimes I feel bad about calling it rape,1b,help-seeking,1,"What he did was make me touch myself while he touched himself to it and I consider it rape. But we were best friends for context and when we were arguing about it afterward he mentioned I’d told people he raped me (which I don’t actually think is true, I didn’t say that) and agreed in that moment that’s not what he did but that he still assaulted me.

But I don’t play the one up game or whatever. I don’t care if he conventionally raped me. If you force someone to stab their self, you’ve just stabbed them with extra steps. He made me use my body for his pleasure and that sounds to me like rape with extra steps and I don’t see any use in calling it by a different name just because it’s not what people expect when they hear the word.

So WHY do I feel like I’m stealing something from other rape victims when I refer to it as rape, refer to him as a rapist, etc? Is is just him fucking with my head still or am I out of my mind?",_blue_morpho_,1,0,16,2020-02-10 10:17:10,rapecounseling
f1sgo4,I (F24) was assaulted by a close friend (M24) and can't seem to move on.. It's starting to affect my relationship. What should I do?,1b,help-seeking,3,"About a year ago a very close friend of mine took advantage of me while we were both extremely drunk and I was asleep. We were at a birthday event in Atlantic City so we split a room with about 6 people. I dont remember getting into bed/falling asleep. I just remember feeling his hand in my underwear trying to get inside me, and then I wake up to my other friend (F24) saying “what the fuck are you doing” and his hand moved out of my underwear quickly and he turned around and went to sleep. I got out of the bed pretending I needed to throw up and then I just slept in the bathroom on the floor for the next 1-2 hours.

I didnt say anything when everyone woke up. I pretended like nothing was wrong and he also pretended nothing happened — I later find out he was blacked out drunk during the whole thing so he didn't even know anything was wrong.

The next day I texted the friend who saw what happened asking her if she could tell me what she saw/heard just so I knew I wasn't dreaming. She was sleeping in the bed with us, me being in the middle of the two of them, and explained she felt rustling in the bed, thought we were hooking up or something and thought it was weird.

(Why she would think it was weird: him and I have known each other since we were 2 years old. We grew up together— my mom used to watch us and our siblings as kids, we’d walk home from school every day up until we graduated, we’ve had hundreds of sleepovers throughout the years with nothing like this ever happening. We’ve never hooked up and have never been into eachother like that. He was like another brother to me.)

She turned around and saw that I was still asleep while his hand was very clearly moving around under the covers.

I texted him asking why he would do something like that to me, anyone really, but me out of all people. I thought he respected me and considered me an equal/friend/family. How he could do something like that after having a really nice heart-to-heart about him being happy for me and my boyfriend at that time. We literally had a conversation about how happy he was I finally found a good guy, just a few hours before this happened.

He was really apologetic, tried calling me several times but I couldnt talk over the phone. He explained he was blacked out and even said thats not an excuse but he wanted me to understand he’d never knowingly do such a thing.

He seemed genuinely sorry.

Which made me feel bad.

I felt like the bad guy for making him upset. I, in no way am at fault in the situation. I know that. But I’ve thought about this night a lot since it’s happened and a lot of stuff from the past resurfaced, things I didn't think were wrong at the time but put altogether make this guy look like an awful person. And I feel like an accomplice to awful things/naive and dumb for putting this dude on a pedestal for so long.

Anyway, we never talked about it again, our relationship is obviously different. I don’t think I’ve been alone with him since, but we’ve been in a group setting several times.

Now here is my dilemma-dilemma. Him and I are part of a group of friends that’ve been close for almost 10 years. My boyfriend (M23) is part of that group (this is a different boyfriend than the one he was happy for me about. The previous bf and I actually broke up because of this exact situation, he didn't think it was a big deal and didn't understand why I was so upset because “he’s my friend and he’s sorry”).

My current boyfriend is amazing in every-way-shape-and-form. We have an awesome relationship because we have a foundation of a good friendship. Although I love my mans to pieces, he has a character flaw that is starting to drive me insane (figuratively and literally).

He thinks everyone is good in nature. He says yes to almost everything, even if he doesnt want to do it or it makes him unhappy. He lets the good in people cloud over the bad things they’ve done, even if they continue to prove who they really are.

He knows about the Atlantic City situation. He knows I’ve been sexually assaulted in the past. He also knows, and told me not too long ago, that this friend of ours has done the same thing he did to me to other girls. Multiple times. All with the same excuse of being “too blacked out to realize”.

Yet he idolizes and loves this guy like he’s some angel who can do no wrong. Now, every time he goes to hangout with him I get this sinking feeling in my stomach and I start to resent my boyfriend so intensely. I get filled with rage and feel hot inside, but instead of communicating this I just internalize it and take it out on him passive aggressively. He notices whats up, pushes to try to get it out of me, but I just cant bring myself to talk about this whole thing again and again. I’m so tired of trying to prove that what happened isn't okay and that he isn't ""my friend too"".. friends don't do this kind of shit to other friends.

We’re supposed to have a talk later after work because he hung out with the molester yesterday and I was being extra bitchy about it all night. I just don't know how to even bring it up. I don't want to put him in the position of having to choose between us. I would like to think he’d choose me because we love eachother immensely. But I'm also not so sure he sees/is willing to accept the gravity of the situation.

I don't want to break up with him, I really truly don't. But my mental health is slowly deteriorating and I need my boyfriend's full support in order to not lose my mind.

I guess I'm here to get this off my chest and to see if I'm overreacting. Because I feel like I am.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR-- About a year ago, a mutual friend of boyfriend and I sexually assaulted me while he was blacked out and I was drunk asleep. Boyfriend is still very close with him despite knowing about the situation. We're supposed to talk about it more tonight because I've been acting strange and pushing boyfriend away. Don't know how to make it clear this guy isn't my friend, like boyfriend keeps saying he is.",wickitywickitywecked,1,0,2,2020-02-10 16:10:57,rapecounseling
f1wt6r,When to tell......,1a,help-seeking,2,"Hey question, I had a incident a long time ago (like 10 years) in which I was sexually assaulted. I was in denial for a long time and there was a lot of crazy fallout (years' worth) but in retrospect it was a pretty obvious case, police-reportable etc. I have sometimes told guys I dated in the past but doing so, in one relationship in particular, led to some pretty bad issues. But it's something that even though I don't want to, I'm not sure why but I seem to remember that it happened like, at least daily but lately 4 or 5 times a day or so because I had a mildly triggering instance I guess. Anyway I have this boyfriend I really like who I've been with for 6 months. Even though I feel it was a long time ago and I'm somewhat past it I also just kind of really want to tell him, I'm not sure why but it feels like I just want to.... I'm not sure if that's a bad idea? I'm really afraid it will make him feel bad or think about sex with me differently or just see me differently? And once I say it I can't take it back.

f20k99,Guidance appreciated,1b,help-seeking,3,"I would like to preface this with the fact that I am not looking to press charges, but am simply looking for guidance.

I am a few years removed from college, and experienced something at the start of my senior year that I was able to suppress for some time, but it has resurfaced and I’m not myself anymore.

I am a male and one of my friends had a friend friend visiting. He made it evident that he was bisexual and we all had been hanging out for the entire day. When we got to the bar later that night, we all were drinking. This guy was a cool dude, and had been out of college with a real job making money for about a year or two. He kept ordering me drinks... and being a broke college student I was certainly not going to deny someone offering me a drink. I didn’t think anything of it because I made it very evident that not only was I not gay/bi, but I had a gf as well. (And I don’t discriminate on gays, nor was he really making moves or being openly gay towards me. He said he understood what I had told him) Nonetheless, the person he came to visit was leaving and he decided to stay out with me and some of the other friends that were out. He said his phone died and didn’t know how to get to his friends and asked if he could crash at my place. I made it very clear again, that I was not interested in him nor wanted any type of advances made on me, but said that he could crash on my couch (I tried calling my friend but his phone was dead and he was asleep). This guy then bought beers from the bar to go, upon which we all went to someone’s house and kept drinking for awhile. At this point I was hammered and the night started becoming a blur. I don’t remember the walk home or much of being at that persons house either. I do remember unlocking my door after leaving our friends and pointing to the couch saying that’s where you’re sleeping, upon which he responded that he just wanted to see the setup of my room. I again made it clear that I did not feel comfortable with him sleeping in my room and said that I was not gay. (Looking back, it all adds up, but I was naive and sadly now understand what some girls go through with guys taking advantage of them). We get to my room and he doesn’t even look at anything, just immediately falls to the ground and acts like he fell asleep immediately. I started kicking him in the ribs saying to get out of my room but he wouldn’t move, which again looking back just shows his intentions (I know very few people that can immediately fall asleep on a pile of shoes on the floor) It was around 4AM at this point and after a couple of minutes of him not moving I just said fuck it and passed out on my bed. Less than about two hours later while I was asleep (I know it had to be around 6AM because out of my window I could barely see the sun up yet) he had my pants down with a condom on me sucking my dick. I had no idea how this had happened, but was not only hammered, but in the deepest part of a persons sleep. I said what are you doing and he replied that I said I wanted it. I am perfectly comfortable with my heterosexuality and know that I was not interested in this man, but again, I just feel I was taken advantage of. 

Looking back, everything he did was so calculated. Not only did I make it clear multiple times I was not interested, he made his move while I was already asleep.

Like I said at the start of this, my gf was there for me and was the only person who knew for awhile, but she was so supportive that I was able to suppress it. We broke up at the end of my senior year and I was able to keep myself busy and just not really think about it. Some things have happened recently though that have triggered the memories of what I do remember from that night and I’m having trouble coping with it. I have mood swings and out lashes of anger. I plan on meeting with a therapist now that the anger just has continued to grow, but was hoping some people may have advice on how to deal with it and move forward from it. Just typing this all out, I do feel a little more relieved, but know it’ll only be temporary. Any tips would be greatly appreciated.",lostmylight23,1,0,1,2020-02-11 1:14:43,rapecounseling
f219ya,Valentine's Day rape *trigger warning*,1a,rant,2,"Obviously not everyone loves Valentine's Day for various reasons, but for me it's just a painful reminder of the night I was drugged and date-raped on the bathroom floor of my own bar.  I'd recognize the ""anniversary"" of any day of the year of course, but the fact that this day is broadcasted all over social media/tv/daily conversation just makes it that much more painful.  I'll have to go to work and pretend I'm not replaying that night in my head all day..have to feign normalcy so people don't think I'm just bitter and lonely because I didn't have a giant teddy bear and chocolates thrust in my arms that morning.  I still feel such shame about it and I know every year I just shut down and go through the day on auto-pilot..but this year I've just started a new job around kids that have been through similar circumstances and I'm worried I won't be able to contain it well enough.  I wish I could just spend the day in bed and pretend it doesn't exist.
It'll be four years this Friday but it's still fresh.  Having been drugged, I only have flashes of memory anyway.  Getting mouth-fucked and gagging with tears streaming down my face..being turned around and pounded ruthlessly, so hard he slipped and went in my ass, kept going of course.  I remember the smell of the toilet cleaner, I remember the panic I felt when he said he wanted to take me to his friend's house.  I remember staggering out to my car and somehow making my way home.  I ran off the road and puked bright pink pineapple-raspberry scented alcohol all over the interior.  I got home and broke down when I told my mom what happened..she went and threw away my seat covers and I went to bed.  I woke up at 3 am feeling like filth and bawling because I couldn't find a bar of soap to scrub him off with.  I tried to do the right thing and get help.  I went to the bar and watched the camera footage to see when he laces my drink..figured if there were proof we could ban him from the bar and he couldn't do it to anyone else.  I went to the hospital and spent 7 1/2 hours in a room getting a rape kit done, just in case he passed me something since he wasn't wearing a condom.  They took pictures of the bruises to my genitals, ran the blood tests, they made me sign all the paperwork..tried to get me to press charges.  I found out he'd ripped my esophagus and sphincter.  I leaked poop out of my butt for weeks, having never had anal sex before.  And still all my ""friends"" at the bar chalked it up to me just getting too drunk.  I worked one more shift there after that..couldn't stop crying.  So I moved to another state and started over.  I only came back for holidays to see my family..maybe once or twice a year.  Until this past November..I moved back to care for an ill relative.  I figured I was healed enough to come back..but with Valentine's Day coming up, and me being back in the town where it happened..it's gonna be hard as fuck.

f25fyr,How do I get over not reporting it?,1b,help-seeking,2,"Not reporting it is the “reasonable” choice. I already tried talking to the police, but I was confused and traumatized and unable to explain what happened, and they didn’t believe me and told me out of reporting. I had a rape kit done after it happened, but it only proves we had sex. They could also tell I had vaginal and anal tears and that I was bleeding, but he can still claim it was consensual, and he will, I was way too drunk to fight back. I have no idea who that man is, and if I don’t report him I don’t have to see him or deal with him again. I blame myself so much and I am still trying to get over it, and the process of reporting will probably make it worse because the police will blame me too for a lot of the things I did that night. The will think it is a “grey area” case that will never go to trial. And I am afraid he will find out who I am and threaten me or hurt me if I report him. He doesn’t know my name, I want to keep it that way.

But I still can’t let go of the idea of reporting it. I hate that there will be no consequences for him and no official record that it happened. I had that the police called me a liar and I just let them do it. I want to come back and make an official report and let them know I stand by everything I said.

Basically, my only chance that the case will go anywhere is if other people have reported him too.  But I think it is very likely that he has other victims. Maybe he hasn’t been reported yet, but he might be in the future.

I have written about what happened a bunch of times, but I will try to summarize it:
I was drunk, I was lost and alone in a dark remote area, I tried to get a cab, he stopped, I got in the car because I thought it was a cab and he started driving. I was scared, I told him to take me home, he said he wanted to stop at his place and get a cigarette, he asked me if I wanted one and I went with him, I remember think I did not want anything to happen with him, the next thing I remember is being on his bed, his is taking my dress up and I am helping him because I am so confused, I realize everything is wrong, I roll away from him and tell him several times I don’t want it to happen, he gets mad at me, I repeat I don’t want it, he pulls down my tights and underwear and starts having sex with me, it happens so fast I literally don’t have time to prevent it, I freeze, lie totally still and wait for it to be over.

I think he was planning the whole thing, I think he was preying on me because I was drunk and alone and he will do something similar again, but the police don’t take me seriously because I went to his apartment willingly.

f25nuy,How do you move on?,1b,help-seeking,2,"About a month ago, I (M) was sexually assaulted by my best friend (F) 

I see her every day and I just cant get it out of my head. Even though it wasnt rape I still have had 3 panic attacks at random times. So how are you supposed to move on when you see them everyday? How are you supposed to go away from them if they are in your main friend group? 

She is the baby of the group and was raped herself. If I say anything about how she sexually assaulted me or how she touches me she will get all teary and cry until someone comes and makes me the bad guy. My entire friend group doesn't take what she did to me seriously. Only the friends who were at the party know that she was touching my genital, groping me, trying to force herself on me, smother me in her boobs while she grinded on me, ect. But even they dont know the full extent. And everytime I see her I get defensive. Only one friend knows how touchy she is and wont baby her.

Its stupid. I found out that her and my best friend from before I moved was raped and I started looking at statistics to find the chance of that. It turns out that *cough cough* you are more likely to be raped at a friends house at 6 pm *cough cough* and I just feel stupid I got stronger to defend myself and learned the statistics to not go in these situations. But of course I get sexually assaulted. Mabe that's why my mind is dwelling on this, because I know that I should have been able to get out of that situation.

I ended up telling my friend about it and he didnt understand. He was at the party and saw it happen but thinks I'm over reacting. I told my moms friend about it and she knows what it's like. It bugs me though. She said ""It shows you are a good person that you didnt take advantage of the situation. Some guys would take her advance and go with it."" Does that make me a good person I dont think so. All I did was freeze and try and think my way out of it and then it was done.

f2643t,I’m just so fucking angry at this point,1b,rant,2,"I was held down and raped by three of my “friends” when I was sixteen. It was filmed. One of my rapists posted “I fucked a virgin last night and she didn’t even know it” on Twitter the next day. I spoke up about it once, and someone just said “No way. You’re too ugly to be raped.”

I’m twenty-three now. I finally filed a police report over a year ago, after I found out one of the men joined the police academy.

Witnesses made statements to the police and reached out to me directly to offer support. The video wasn’t recovered, but two witnesses acknowledged they’ve seen the video.

I don’t think about it much anymore, but I get furious when I hear about another sexual assault in the news. Heartbroken for those women and furious that my attackers + so many others are freely walking around and living normal lives.

It’s been thirteen months since I filed the police report, and the defective assigned to my case hasn’t met with me ONCE despite saying multiple times he must follow up with me in person to proceed with the investigation.

What the fuck? I am generally a joyful and bubbly person, but I am just feeling so so mad about this right now. Nobody cares. Nobody ever cared this happened to me.

f29sc6,My gf was raped when she went out to a bar.,1b,rant,2,"This happened a year before we met. We've been together for a while now and I'm just starting to understand the details of what happened to her. She remembers nothing after she and her friend were handed drinks by a group of guys (I think 4-5). A friend of hers found her in an alley near the bar at the end of the night and her clothes were disheveled. She woke up the next morning with no phone wallet or any of her things or memoryof anything before the drink. Her vagina was sore for about 2 weeks after the fact and she had finger print bruises on her triceps and on her thighs. Shes told me that there was a friend of hers there that saw she and another friend making out with the same guy and seemed to be having fun (very unlike her personality). Later she found out snapchats were being sent of her alone with a group of guys and she seemed happy and smiling. The picture were darker I guess but clear so she may not have been at the bar anymore. All of these things seem very unlike her and its shaken my understanding of the person she is. I try not to victim blame, but I have a hard time understanding that she would appear happy to be leaving with a bunch of guys. Aside from that, my main problem is trying to be supportive of her while also dealing with my feelings about the situation. I cannot stop imagining a group of guys having sex with her and it's really becoming an issue for me (i.e. I have no desire for sex or to be intimate with her).

I understand that it's something in the past that I should get over, but for some reason I cant stop imagining the logistics vividly and I cant stop wondering if she enjoyed it and I think that just makes me uncomfortable because I'm a very monogamous person and I've always know her to be as well. I'm just really troubled. I love her and I want to forget it or stop thinking about it but I cant seem to and it's really unfair to her. I just dont know what to do and I have no one to talk to about this so I guess I'm just throwing out a line.",chockabanastraw,1,0,8,2020-02-11 15:22:40,rapecounseling
f2a4if,This is FUCKING UP my life...,1b,rant,2,"Hello everyone, I have never done this. Post this on the internet... never crossed my mind cause of the consequences. But today is not a good day for me. I woke up non stop thinking about this man and what he did to me. It was a long time ago, more than five years ago and it fucks me up so much that still today it feels like it’s ruining my life. I think about this every day at least once. Its taken over my relationships negatively and it even controls the way I relate to new people. It’s really hard for me to make friends and even visiting or hanging out takes me into deep anxiety attacks that usually end up with me in the bathroom puking or with terrible diarrhea.  It’s like i need days to prepare my mind and body for hangouts. Ive tried marihuana to ease my mind but in the end it just makes it worse. It’s interfering with my sexual relationship with my partner as well, it’s very hard for me to get in the “mood” since I just push away every sexual desire cause’ it makes me feel dirty, I don’t feel comfortable. Those feelings some how make me feel vulnerable and remind me of that moment when this man took from me my peace of mind and my security.  And for those of you reading, you might be thinking the worse things might have happened to me... but in part thats what makes me so angry! Cause’ i feel like so many other people have had it worse than me and go on living. While i just have to deal with a man who forcefully made me “jack him off” inside a small, one person bathroom at a bar in old san juan. He was the bar owner and we had been cordial since the first day i walked in. My friends and i used to go there a lot and we kinda became friends. But nothing like hang out buddies, more like a “hey, whats up? All is well” kinda vibe.  One day we ended up going there and I was already drunk from the pre-game. Something I used to do was make out with one of my GF when we got wasted in the bathroom. So, her and I were in the bathroom making out and when we decided to leave she was able to open the door and get out but as soon as she left and i was walking behind her, he pushes me in and locks the door. He stands in front of it completely blocking it. The bathroom is so small i can barely move to get away from him. He takes out his penis and starts touching me all over, he grabs my face and sticks his tongue inside my mouth.  Mean while im trying to push him off me but it’s not working. I take his hands and move them away from me and im screaming at him to let me out. He doesn’t. As I am grabbing his hands to back them away from my body and my private parts he leads them to his penis and says “ if you want this to stop and leave you are going to have to at lest blow me or jack me off”. By then im just terrified cause’ in my mind I am sure if i don’t comply, he will surely rape me. A while had passed and no body heard me scream or tried to get into the bathroom, so at this point im fearing for my life. So taking all of this into consideration I start to do it. It has been the longest, most denigrating, most horrific thing I’ve had to do in my life. He finally comes in my hand. Im pale as a ghost at this point. Holding back my tears like a fucking champ, I wash my hands and he finally lets his guard down enough for me to push him aside and run out of the door.  Im loosing my mind, trying to find my friends in the crowd and when I finally do and tell them what just happened NON of them believed me. Why??? Why??? still to this day I have no fucking idea why in the world they wouldn’t believe me!  The only thing they said was to leave. So we did.  I went home and acted like nothing had happened cause’ everyone made me feel like it wasn’t a big deal. They made me feel like I must have been lying cause if my GF was able to leave the bathroom so could I.  They didn’t understand nor care apparently. So I brushed it off and pretended like it didn’t bother me. Its been more than five years now since that day, and I sometimes feel like I am still stuck inside that bathroom.  Needless to say, we aren’t friends anymore and I haven’t  been able to make any since I don’t trust anyone. I am in a stable relationship and I told him what happened and he is very supportive but still, it doesn’t change how I feel. I don’t know what to do to. I am not a weak person nor am I looking for sympathy.  I just want to feel normal again... I hate this.",kittykc04,1,0,15,2020-02-11 15:46:40,rapecounseling

I (24F) am currently moving forward with my sexual assault case and the legal proceedings. I don't know how demanding it will be or if it will take time away from work.

f2f1yg,Desperately looking for help. Trying to stop hyper sexuality after rape. I think that’s what’s wrong with me but I’m not a psychiatrist.,1a,help-seeking,2,"I posted in another group under a throw away account but got no response. If anyone has dealt with anything like this I really could use help. I guess I’m struggling with hyper sexuality. I was raped anally in a club when I was 23. I was a stripper so to some people especially a lot I’ve met, think strippers don’t deserve the same response as others. But I don’t tell anyone what happened I just listen to what people say and pretend I don’t know anything. I guess to some it’s something I had coming because of lifestyle choices and plus I’m sure no one would care. Which I’m fine with but I’m stressing out because I have no one to talk too. The owner of the club kept giving me drinks but I don’t remember the whole thing thank goodness but I remember enough to hate myself. I woke up in the hospital the next day thanks to some other girls who took me out of the club and left me there. Which was actually decent because they thought I had been drugged. I was so out of it. Every once In a while I have like a flash of a random little memory from it. Like the color of the velvet curtain as my face was pushed into it. and I remember feeling boxes of paper at my fingers. So things like that kind of set me off. Afterward the guy would come to my job regularly and try to give me money. So I took some of it I regret it to this day. I always say I shouldn’t have taken the money. But I was able to get enough to move across the country. One day I got up the courage to tell him to stop coming in right before I left. But now I struggle with myself. Every time the thought pops in my head I get sooooo mad at myself that I feel all this crazy aggression building through my body and I begin to shake. And the only way to relieve that, I feel is having extremely rough sex or putting matches to my hip, it’s easy to hide burns there. I’m now 33 and married and my husband knows everything but I feel bad that when we have sex I feel like I need to be hurt a little so I ask him to be rough which is ok but I can tell it bothers him sometimes because of the reasoning behind it. Is anyone else experiencing this? There’s so much more but I think this is the after shock that I’m struggling with the most.",Plainbanana,1,0,13,2020-02-11 21:07:34,rapecounseling
f2l9hq,is this considered rape?,1b,help-seeking,2,"Hey guys. I've always wondering if I've been in the wrong for considered this ""rape"" or not and I've never talked to anyone about this and I just need to ease my mind. So my junior year of high school after a football game all of my cheerleader friends and I went to a party, I had a couple of drinks and was a bit tipsy. I had a crush on this football player and we would flirt with each other over text but would never hangout. So that night we were texting while at the same party and he asked if I wanted to come over after and cuddle with him. I was like yes!!!! so I told all of my friends he wanted to hangout with me, they dropped my off at his house, and he started to kiss and then he wanted to have sex, touching me and trying to take my clothes off and I kept saying ""no, I don't want to"" while trying to push him off. he kept saying yes and kept continuing, after saying no get off of me a good 20 times he was getting his way with me, so I just let him. after that, the same night I had my friends come pick me up again, I never said a peep. two weeks later my friend was dating his close friend, she begged me to come with her to his house to go swimming so I was like okay ill go. the guy who I slept with two weeks before was there. the guys were pushing drinks on us so we started drinking. I had one beer I was not tipsy drunk not anything. my friend and her boyfriend went into his bedroom... I was left with the guy I had slept with, he started kissing me and trying to hug and hold me and I yet again told him no I don't want to... he kept trying so I let him have sex with me again. please help me get my mind right about this. did he ""rape"" me the first time if I let him have sex with me again??? this was almost four years ago, he has a family now and is in the military.. I don't want him to get in trouble I just need to forget about this.",Carefulthinking21,1,0,13,2020-02-12 4:09:38,rapecounseling
f2mdk2,I don’t know what to call what he did to either of us but I’m so mad that he hurt her and I feel so broken,1b,rant,2,"I’ve been struggling with this for 8 months now, and it still hurts. I’m still scared. I am still friends with him (my ex boyfriend, we’ll call him T) and every time we talk or hand out I feel scared and jumpy and I cry after but I keep spending time with him anyway, keep telling myself he’s a good person anyway, keep defending him to other people anyway. Maybe I actually believe it, or maybe I think that if he’s a good person then it didn’t happen. In a way it’s less scary if it was my fault. 
It’s been hard to talk about it because some people are understanding but a lot of people just tell me that I’m being overdramatic, to the point where I basically believe it. Even when they try to be supportive, they say things like “you’re allowed to feel however you feel” and “I’m sorry you feel that way” like T did nothing wrong and the only problem is my emotions. It was my fault. I had no reason to feel scared, he wouldn’t have actually physically hurt me, right? He’s never hurt me. I just need to stop complaining and move on, it’s been months already why am I still crying about something that only took place over a few minutes that was mostly my fault anyway? Other people have gone through so much worse. It wasn’t rape because T was my boyfriend and we’d had sex before and he was a good person. It doesn’t matter that I repeatedly I told him I didn’t want to, that I was so scared that I felt frozen. If I didn’t want it I should have continued insisting, I should have pushed him off of me and left. It was my fault. The only thing wrong is my feelings. T didn’t do anything wrong. If I just stopped being upset about it it would all be okay. I should have gotten over it already, I should have moved past it.
I told myself that for 8 months. I told myself the reason I felt so jumpy and like I just wanted to curl up into a ball and disappear when I was around T was because I missed him. I told myself the reason I was afraid of having sex ever again was because I was too self conscious or too sensitive. I told myself that I must have done something wrong to make him act that way. I put myself in that situation, by having sex with him and being alone with him even though my friends seemed suspicious of him. I trusted him blindly. It was so out of character from how T was with me most of the time, maybe I imagined it. Maybe I’ve always been like this.
But then I talked to a former friend of T who told me they didn’t like how he treated the people he dated. I didn’t consciously realize what that meant, but I guess I knew deep down. I felt sick to my stomach and super jumpy for the rest of that evening even though he wasn’t around. I didn’t sleep much that night. I actually posted on a different sub because I couldn’t sleep and I was feeling really alone while three of my friends were asleep nearby and I couldn’t go see anyone else because I was in an unfamiliar city away from everyone I know and several people pointed out that it sounded like I was traumatized. I felt traumatized but I didn’t believe I had any reason to be. Sure, sometimes I can’t lie down in bed without feeling T on top of me and feeling his hands on me and feeling all of the fear and loneliness and emptiness I felt while it was happening. But that wasn’t his problem. He didn’t mean to. He’s a good person, he’s just gone through some stuff so he messes up sometimes. He just didn’t realize. Sure, I made it clear that I didn’t want to. But T was tired and stressed and going through a lot of stuff. I’m just too easily broken. His only mistake was not being careful enough. I could have insisted. I could have pushed him away.
If hearing that vague statement about how T treated his girlfriends badly wasn’t enough, I’ve been spending a lot more time with another ex of his lately who I used to be closer friends with when we were younger (we’ll call her S). I knew they had dated, and I knew that S hated T but I didn’t know why. When I asked him he didn’t actually tell me what happened, just that S was hurt by it. I finally texted her a few days ago and she responded with a long explanation of what happened. It was so creepy how similar her story was to mine given that I never told her what happened to me. S broke up with T because he did to her what he did to me. Didn’t listen when she said no, took her clothes off and touched her more roughly than he had in the past, didn’t seem like he was himself, his eyes sort of glazed over and his voice devoid of emotion. Didn’t notice when she froze up and expressed distress and fear. Had sex with her despite her telling him she was scared and didn’t want to. Didn’t stop or even seem to notice when she started crying or whimpering in pain. S finally spoke up louder and made him stop partway through, I didn’t. I just let it happen because I was too scared and too weak. Because I had already told him I didn’t want to, what difference would it make for me to repeat it? S was strong enough to break up with T, if he hadn’t broken up with me himself shortly after I don’t know what would have happened. I thought I knew him at least a little bit. But I don’t. I don’t understand why he did what he did when he didn’t have to force or pressure either me or S to have sex with him. He wanted it right then, I guess? He wanted to be more forceful even though neither of us wanted it, even though the sudden change in his behavior was terrifying.
A lot of things still don’t make sense and I’m wondering whether I should confront him about it given that we still talk (S cut off contact with T right after breaking up with him). But at least I don’t feel crazy anymore. At least a lot of the weird details align exactly with what S experienced. I still don’t understand why he was suddenly so different. Thinking back, I remember him being sort of like that when he was having a really hard time (T has ptsd, and he hurt S on the day that the thing that caused it happened 9 years earlier). But I wasn’t alone in private with him when he was like that before.
Now me and S are both worried about the girl he’s been dating for the past 8 months (yes, he got with her only a few days after breaking up with me. I didn’t believe it initially but he admitted it when I confronted him and told me that it wasn’t what it looked like), L. Neither S or myself are particularly fond of L at this point, even though it hasn’t always been that way. I’ve heard from a mutual friend that L doesn’t talk about her relationship with T at all, so the only things I know about it are from T, who has lied to me in really big, messed up ways many times before. Both S and I had wondered about telling her what happened just so she could be careful and hopefully not have that happen to her but she probably would have thought that either of us was just attempting to sabotage her relationship. Now that S and I both know that there’s at least a bit of a pattern, and that we have two sources to confirm T’s behavior, we’re wondering whether to try to tell L together. And whether he’s done this to anyone else. Because it’s just so weird, it’s not just the fact that he didn’t listen to the word “no” it’s this super specific pattern of behavior accompanied by a lot of lying and gaslighting and manipulation. Like maybe when T’s reliving trauma his way of dealing with it is scaring and hurting someone else, someone who trusts him. Someone who would do anything for him and is worried because they know what he’s going through. At this point everyone who knows me or S with some familiarity knows how we both feel about T, with S hating him and me continuing to try to defend him while simultaneously openly admitting that he’s lied to me repeatedly and messed with my head. Even people who don’t know either of us very well have heard from our friends, as gossip tends to go. One of the reasons I initially didn’t tell my friends what had happened was that I didn’t want it to cause anyone to think of T in a bad light, just because of one time that he seemed like a stranger and pushed me into sex when I told him I was scared and I didn’t want it and a bunch of lies he told me that I can’t 100% confirm are lies. And who was I to try to deny him sex, anyway? 
When I told him I was scared and I didn’t want to do it, he told me to not worry so much, but in a way that made me feel like I was being stupid and childish. He told me to stop thinking about it. He made me feel guilty for telling him no over some silly fears.
After S told me what happened to her, I broke. I found myself unable to be alone because the fear lingering in the back of my mind was in the forefront and I felt exposed and afraid and on edge. I had to realize that the situation really happened the way I remembered it, and that T, someone I cared about, had done the exact same thing to at least one other person. I started crying in front of a good friend of mine, J, which is a lot given that I haven’t cried at all in front of someone who isn’t my therapist or my mother in a few years. I told her how scared I was and that I just wanted it to stop and I didn’t understand why it still hurt so much, because even though learning about what happened to S made it worse it was still bothering me months later. J told me that of course it wasn’t my fault, of course what he did was wrong, of course he didn’t do it because there was something wrong with me. She said that what he did was rape, and I know that it does technically meet some definitions of rape but it feels wrong to call it that. I don’t want to take away from the experiences of people who’ve had it much worse, I don’t want anyone else to judge me and think that I’m making too big a deal out of nothing, and I definitely don’t want to think of myself as a victim or T as a rapist. That word is so awful. But I feel awful. And I know that S, who’s better than me and stronger than me, is also still affected even though it’s been like a year since it happened to her. 
I can’t think about anything else and I can’t talk about it with most people and even the people I talk about it with have already heard enough about how I’m upset that T had sex with me when I didn’t want it. I don’t want to be the girl who cries about something so irrelevant. But it doesn’t feel irrelevant. It feels awful. And I’m so scared. And I just want it to go away but after 8 months I’ve forgotten what it was like before.
I’m still so confused. When I started writing this post I was thinking that of course it was rape, J told me it was and it wasn’t consensual and it felt wrong and he seemed to know in some way that it was wrong. But I’m just so lost and I don’t know anything and nothing makes sense and nothing is right. Maybe it really is wrong for me to call it rape. I just don’t know anymore. All I know is the pain and fear and hollowness. Maybe I’m just too easily broken.
I texted T to make plans to meet up in person to confront him because I need to know why he was so weird when it happened, I need to know who he was. He responded and was super nice and I felt guilty for being mad at him. I know that he lies almost constantly. I know that he’s messed up. But even after everything I trust him so much more than I trust myself. 
I’m so mad that he hurt her, because hurting me might have been justified in some way, but she’s just an amazing person and she’s smart and kind and loving and she didn’t deserve that at all.
I’m also confused because he was my first sexual partner, and we weren’t together for a super long time so we really only had sex a few times and I haven’t had sex with anyone since him and I don’t know what it’s actually supposed to be like. Is this just something that happens? Am I just complaining about something that happens to everyone?
I also feel like it’s my fault for becoming traumatized because I chose to have sex initially and it happened so soon after and I feel like I’m being punished for that decision. Like if I had just been good and pure and waited for someone I was in love with this wouldn’t have happened.
I don’t know if any of this even makes any sense but I needed to write it down so I don’t feel completely crazy. I’m scared to post this but maybe it’ll help? Maybe someone will be willing to read it and will have some insight.",thatravenhairedgirl,1,0,2,2020-02-12 5:39:00,rapecounseling
f2n7xz,Incest,1b,help-seeking,2,"Whew, is this what the 2 followers I gained from my last post was waiting for? Seriously, why did you follow me? I’m not that active. Were you hoping I would go into more detail about my uncle fantasies? Incest a hot topic for you? Sorry to crush your dreams. 


Mostly.


Lol. 


You get your dream half fulfilled. 


.


I have nightmares of my family raping me. Except, it’s not the bad ones. It’s the good ones. I’ve been raped and harassed by four family members. Well, three and a half. One was just my mom’s cousin groping my breast twice as I was showing him music. Unwanted, but fairly harmless because I instantly removed myself from his presence. Yay me. So three and a half rapes and harassments yet those are not the ones I dream about. (With one exception *cue my last post*). The good ones that haven’t hurt me are the ones I dream about. They haven’t touched me, so what do I have to fear? They’re the good ones. I’m wary of all my family. Which is sad because they didn’t hurt me so they don’t deserve my distance. It’s understandable, but I still feel bad. I feel unease with most friendly actions my family has towards me. I think everything they do has an ulterior motive. My brother will pin me down and tickle me and my first thought is “he is going to rape me”. Which is sad because ever since I was a kid I longed to be close to him. I *want* him to tickle me and tease me and be an annoying brother like most brothers are. But he can’t because I’m scared of family. I love my family. But I’m scared of my family. 


But I love my family. 


Sometimes I get thoughts like Sex = Love and in order to get Love from my family I have to have Sex with them. I dream about my family raping me. Except it’s not so bad because they Love me and Sex is just a small price to pay for Love. Sometimes I have dreams where I initiate the Sex because I want to be a Family again and Family = Love = Sex. At least that’s what I’ve learned from past experiences. These dreams are conflicting because I feel loved but also scared. What a rollercoaster of emotions. Love and Fear. Love, Fear, Love, Fear, Love Fear LoveFearlovefearlovefearlovefearlovefear wake up. Sometimes my nightmares aren’t nightmares anymore. They’re sex dreams. 100%. Consensual. Sex dreams. No fear. All love. And honestly, I think I’d prefer the nightmares. That seems to be a common theme with me. Wanting Worse so I can stop feeling like a Bad person. Incest is such a taboo topic, even in rape circles. I never see anyone share experiences similar to mine, which makes me not want to share my experiences, but also want to share my experiences more because then other people with experiences like mine can come out and share their experiences. I hope other people has similar experiences. Not because I wished they were raped, but because I don’t want to be the only one. It’s one thing to be raped by family but another thing to have incestuous dreams about family because of it. I hate mentioning these dreams to anyone because, well, I don’t want people to think I’m gross or look down on me. Please don’t think I’m gross or look down on me. I love my family. I’m not in love with my family. I don’t want to have sex with my family. I just think they all want to have sex with me. Though, I will say, incest doesn’t give me the ‘eww’ reaction anymore like it gives most people. I’m just uninterested. Like, I don’t want to suck my brothers dick but if he ever asked me to suck his dick I wouldn’t be appalled. I’d be uncomfortable, but hey, it means he’s paying attention to me so it can’t be that bad. 


Please let someone else share my experience. I hate being the only one. I read about this being common in victims of incest but I’ve never actually seen anyone mention it anywhere.",Youre_Grounded,1,0,0,2020-02-12 6:54:27,rapecounseling

f30qfu,I fucking hate this so much!,1b,rant,3,"I hate not knowing how to classify what happened. 

I hate how it bothers me still. Hate how I can’t stop obsessing over it. I want nothing more than to let it go. But for some reason I can’t. 

I hate the fact that at one point I thought it was just “sucky and awkward but at the end of the day consensual” sex. 

I hate that my friends thought it was anything else. Made me aware it could be anything else. 
I hate that now I am convinced. Whether it is true or not. It’s the way I feel now. And I hate that it is a part of my personal narrative

I hate feeling so fucking invalid. I hate that some dark part of me wishes that I had been drunk or forced or something more concrete because at least then I would know what happened was real. And that my feelings are justified. At least then I could see my experience reflected in the media and not feel so fucking alone (I know that is so sick and twisted and borderline insulting and don’t worry. I hate myself more than anyone else could ever hate me) 

I hate that no matter how many times I said no, he just kept trying. Even when I pulled away violently. Even when I went somewhere else. Even when he was legit physically restraining me from harming myself

I hate that I didn’t just leave. I could have. He wouldn’t have physically stopped me. 

I hate that it was basically 3 days of mindfucking, fights, suicide attempts (on my part), and nonstop sexual advances (which I kept saying no to just leading to more fights) 

I hate that eventually he found the thing to say that flipped the switch in my head to where now I was willing to do what he wanted and saw it as logical. 

I hate that I can’t remember how the actual sex was initiated. Like how it happened. 

I hate that I said yes (or at least let him and participated more than just laying there) 




Below I pasted like what actually happened so you can just scroll all the way to the bottom if you don’t want to see it/don’t care:

So this happened when I first met my online (now ex) boyfriend in person. 

He like for 3 straight days he kept trying. Every 5 minutes. We would be cuddling. And he would inevitably try to intiate. How far I let his hands go would vary. But inevitably I would stop him. And move his hands back. And then 5 minutes later he would try again. And again. I confronted him about not respecting me and he cried and said he felt like a terrible person but hen the next day he did the same shit. No matter how far I let him go. He wanted more. Sometimes I would tell him he could put his hand on the outside of my ass/vagina and every fucking time he would try to like go inside it. I tried to kill myself 5 times over the course of those 3 days and at one point he chased me around the room to get the thing I was going to use and then he touches me and says ""you're wet"" which like priorities man. At one point I was fucking violently pulling away when he would try to touch me but yet every fucking 10 minutes he still kept trying. He kept getting upset when I didn't want to. For 3 fucking days. Until. On Thursday. He tried more of the same. And I said no again and we had another fight. I was so scared he would leave me. So the next time he tried to. I let him. He checked in. And I said it was fine. I could have said no. And he would have stopped. At least for then until he inevitably tried again 5 minutes later. But I didn't. Because I didn't want him to leave me. And I fucking hate myself for it. I feel like that girl who like has regrettable sex and then makes a big deal out of nothing. And that makes me hate myself. becayse I said yes. And like I know coerced half insane consent isnt really consent but idk. I just hate myself a lot. And the person I am now. The stable ish person. Would never have let that happen.

f328ug,I’m so confused. Sometimes I feel like I have a crush on the person who assaulted me,1b,survey,1,"I was assaulted by someone I had a crush on. He is objectively very conventionally attractive. Most people would agree on that. I can’t help but see him and think “oh my god he’s so hot” but then I remember what he did to me (and I KNOW I didn’t want it that time). He coerced me. I don’t respect him at all for how he treated me that night. 
I’m kind of a fan-girl type of girl lol. I swoon over hot men and get heart eyes whenever I see attractive guys. It’s like a natural reaction. So when I get that reaction thinking about him, it’s confusing. Because he literally assaulted me and took advantage of me.

I never met the girl. But I found out who she is. One thing is I felt like less crazy bc it means I'm not alone, he hurt someone else too (unfortunately). 2nd thing is I also feel so bad bc if she fought him off and ended up getting away without being raped, I wish I did too and feel worse about not. 3rd thing is I want to reach out.

Currently I have some sort of cyst or something on my labia majora that I really need to get checked out, but I’m too scared to go to the gynecologist. If I go to get the cyst checked out, my Male Doctor will have to touch me, and I just don’t want that to happen.

f38vos,Sometimes I want to make myself too intoxicated to consent and just see what happens,1a,rant,2,"It's so tempting to get loaded in public and act slutty at concerts and leave my drink unattended. The thought flashed across my mind at a punk show I went to a few months ago. The main gig even had a lyric about being groped while moshing. In practice, though, I only feel safe drinking much in front of friends and family, so that's why I bring them with me to make sure I keep my risk-taking tendencies in check. I pretty obviously wouldn't be this way if I wasn't sexually abused. I hate that I'm so morbidly tempted to put myself in danger. I hate that I'm so self-aware about it too. It's as though I'm compelled by something visceral inside me to just put a big sign on my head that reads ""violate me"". I've never done it, but  only through sheer force of will and my self-respect. But the urge to self-destruct is still there. Still programmed inside me by my abuse. It wasn't there before. It's like my abuser made a home inside my head and can visit me telepathically at any time. I hear her voice inside my head a lot. ""Why don't you trust me?"" ""Bend over, babe."" Et cetera. I fear deep down that all I need is one shitty day at work for me to spiral then get plastered and slutty at a gay bar. That's all it took when I was breaking down this time last year, 6 months after I was raped. This is why i still have that voice that tells me it's my fault. All my life I've done shit to put myself in harm's way. That's how I met my rapist in the first place. Why can't I stop letting abusers run my life?",SW96,1,0,2,2020-02-13 11:55:25,rapecounseling
f39nla,Raped/sexual harassment in middle/highschool. Boy on boy. (Maybe a little too much detail-sorry). I dont know if these events resulted in me being bi/also liking males and being Hypersexual? Any help or comments appreciated.,1b,help-seeking,3,"So I was in boarding school from the first grade. I guess boys discover sexual desire/feelings earlier because of the older boys...girl/sex talks, magazines, cellphones, (involuntary) exposure to boys masturbating etc. 
I think I started playing with myself when I was around 11 yo.
The first rape or sexual harassment started when I was around 12 or 13. It was another boy who was two years older. Think he was an early developer because he was quite a lot bigger physically. Anyways...he started provoking me by inappropriately touching me in bed at night. Walking past me and grabbing me etc. Then as this progressed he lured me into the bathroom a few times, always exposing himself. It progressed to me jacking me off and sucking him. (Never penetrated me. Only also touched me. While I was servicing him. He knew my parents were very conservative so always said he was going to tell them the dirty things I do if I tell anyone. This eventually stopped when he moved to another school. 

Now when I was around 16 I started to be/feel very aroused/sexual. Don't really know how to describe it.... I was just thinking a lot about sex and pleasuring myself etc. This has continued to this day but nowadays I control it better. 

The second significant episode happened when I was around 17. Before this happened I started to take an interest in guys, started to get curious in a sexual way but never did anything. 
Then I stayed in a two bedroom room with another guy for a sport weekend. He asked me if I wanted a massage. We were quite sore and I was exhausted so I said yes... obviously I didn't think it would turn sexual but it did. He started to use oil and really gave a thorough massage, eventually removing my shorts while I was laying face down on the bed. By this time I had put a pillow over my head pushing my face into the bed. I was embarrassed that a guy was seeing and touching my butt but I couldn't move or say anything. Then he removed his clothes and penetrated me, fucking me. It was painful but I still couldn't say anything or move. Afterwards we never talked about it and I was very embarrassed. 

It was a couple of years after this that I started to really experiment with guys/men on my own terms. I am now bisexual but I see myself as wanting a wife and a family, while only using guys to get off... sorry if that sounds crass. 
Personally I experience quite a lot of social anxiety. I'm also very self conscious. 
I also have  condition called Paruresis or shy bladder syndrome where you have anxiety about peeing in front of other people. 

I would like to hear your comments on whether these experiences could have resulted in any of these issues I have,  and whether it could have contributed to me being bi/also attracted to males and being Hypersexual.

f3j5tz,My GF recurring trauma,1b,help-seeking,2,"I am sharing this story, not as a victim, but as someone who wants to find better ways to support the one they care for.

So I have been dating this girl for 7 mo or so now and everything has gone more or less perfect. She brought it up to me toward the beginning of our relationship that she used to be in a 3yr abusive relationship some time ago where she had been raped. I could tell then at the glimpse just how much it has affected her and her relationships. I was glad she felt safe to tell me and i assured her i would be supportive in any way i could. Up until just recently we haven’t had any problems with intimacy or showing affection with each other. Little habits would come up - like sitting on the opposite side of the room in groups from me- not because of the way she felt about me but she quickly realized what she was doing, we talked, and i understood. She hasn’t had a strong sex drive throughout are relationship either but i could certainly understand why and is not something that ever bothered me because we’ve had such a positive relationship otherwise. 

Fast forward to just recently, work has ramped up for her, i can tell she’s feeling down, she tells me it’s just stress and a bit of anxiety. A few days go by and i can tell it’s something more. She tells me it’s recurring trauma from her past and she can’t shake it - it makes her depressed, and anxious, and on edge. She tells me there was no real trigger it just came about again.

After i was out of town with work, i come back and what seems out of nowhere she tells me that she has to end things - not for anything wrong with myself or how she feels about me, but because of this trauma is weighing down and she hasn’t ever taken many steps to try and relieve some of it. She has since seeked therapy for the first time and is going tomorrow. 

I care a lot about her and just want to be supportive, it hurts me to no end to see her live with this. I’m curious about ways that are positive and safe communication as a BF/F to be supportive and maintain a romantic relationship? Also curious as to triggers for trauma and if more open communication between a romantic partner is found helpful or more stressful?

Appreciate the responses. Thanks.",gscheetz2,1,0,4,2020-02-13 23:40:26,rapecounseling

This would have been in the spring/Easter holiday in Chicago, so I don't think it would have gotten THAT warm. All I remember was waking up and telling my brother how weird it was that both of us had woken up without our pants on. 2 years ago my mom had asked me if I was ever molested because my Dad's poker buddies were ""creepy"".

f3kshn,CW for kind of a graphic account. I just need to know if these events that have been on my mind lately could be classified as rape/assault. Thank you,1b,help-seeking,3,"*Sorry this is going to be a long post, and pretty graphic just because I need to get this off of my chest.*   
*There are two instances that years later I'm still turning over in my head.  At the time I didn't really know how to classify them, and didn't think I'd have lasting feelings about them.  But here we are.  I would just appreciate your thoughts about if these could be classified as sexual assault, because I've never gotten validation.*

&amp;#x200B;

**1)**This was about 8 years ago.  One of my very close friends had just died suddenly, so I was kind of working through my grief by hanging out with my new OKC boyfriend (I met him soon before she died).  We would basically just hang out and have sex all the time.  

He not really into drugs when I first met him, but he started getting really into smoking weed.  Then at some point he got really into farming bitcoin, and looking at stuff on the dark web, and ended up getting really into psychedelics that he would buy from Silk Road.  We did shrooms a few times together, which was really fun, and then he got some LSD.  He did the LSD by himself a couple of times, and told me it was way more intense than shrooms, and that he would be my sober trip-sitter if I wanted to try it.

I took the acid, and started coming up on it in his room.  From having experienced LSD on one other occasion years later, I can say that this was very potent stuff.  I don't remember if we started with our clothes on or off, but I remember laying in bed naked with him laughing about some ridiculous shit.  As I was peaking I started getting insane visuals and all of the things that come with doing that amount of acid, such as not having full control of my body.  

This is when my boyfriend, who was sober, started having sex with me.  I began laughing hysterically because it was indescribably strange.  It wasn't pleasurable for me, just incredibly, incredibly weird.

*I have trouble classifying this as rape, because we were in a relationship where having sex all the time was what we did.  But then again, I couldn't have consented because I basically wasn't even in my body, and he was supposed to be my trip sitter.*

&amp;#x200B;

**2)** I went out drinking with some of my coworkers.  This is probably about 6 years ago, and at the time I kind of had a flirtatious thing going to with one of the guys I worked with.  We both got pretty drunk at the bar, and might have even been making out, but I knew I just wanted to go home by myself.  

When I got ready to leave he offered me a ride in his friend's car, asking me if they could go to my apartment.  I said ""no, I have people over sorry,"" but accepted the ride because it was snowing and cold outside.  I was sitting in the back seat, and he and his friend were chatting, and I noticed the car veered off the road, and we were driving into a dark parking lot.

I started to freak out internally, but I was too scared to say anything, and couldn't believe what was happening.  The friend parked and exited his car, and my coworker came into the back seat.  This part is kind of hazy.   He unzipped his pants and took out his dick, and tried to get on top of me multiple times.  I remember saying no to him, and he stopped, but then he started again.  I tried to encourage him to touch himself for me, because I thought it would make him stop, but I felt kind of ashamed afterwards like it meant I'd been getting off on it.  

Eventually I started crying, and after a while he stopped, and called his friend back into the car.  

Within the next couple of days I talked to our coworkers who had been there that night, and told them about what had happened (without going into explicit detail), and they just laughed it off.  He sent me a message apologizing and saying he was really drunk and barely even remembers what happened.  

*I've have a hard time classifying this as assault, I guess the fact that I was flirting with him.  And the fact things normalized after that and I even hung out with him, and slept in his bed with him one time.  So it feels like... was it really even traumatic if I was able to hang out with him again?*

**Thanks for reading if you got to the end.

I don’t feel comfortable being alone with any of them. 

He treated me like a fucking toy, like he was just living out his secret hardcore porn fantasies he’d been nursing. I know he watched porn too, cause he fucking told me. They say rape is a crime drive by power but in my case, it really felt more about his sexual pleasure than anything else.
