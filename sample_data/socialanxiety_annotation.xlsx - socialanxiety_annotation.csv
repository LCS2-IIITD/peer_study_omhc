ei7wzx,A tip that helps me - start on your way,0,chitchat,1,"Have something to do/someplace to go? Want to not regret your decision not to go/participate later? Go part of the way.

Once you‚Äôre there consider taking the next step and going/participating out of ‚Äúconvenience.‚Äù

This method isn‚Äôt full proof. But if you‚Äôre like me, I find it working more times than not. For those of us with social anxiety things seem so daunting, it‚Äôs all or nothing.

I took a really good job at a well established company in a new city/state a few months ago after working from home and side-jobs for over a year. 

I burned out SO quickly at this job. It pays well, it's a huge office, but I don't do well with the 9-5 grind. The commute drains and stresses me out, people are confrontational on the transit, and my job feels monotonous.

I know I'm making a great decision for myself, knowing I am making some sacrifices. The only thing I feel guilty about is leaving my ""work"" friends behind. I've only been communicating with my boss via text about things after taking off from work for the past week.

I received a text yesterday from a work friend, and another one today from someone else with them voicing their concerns for me since I didn't text them. She was even ready to send someone for a wellness check, since she knows I'm out here all by myself with no friends or family.

 I consider many people I worked with to be some of my closest friends since moving here. How do I maintain friendships without burning bridges for quitting?

ei9l9w,I need some advice,1b,help-seeking,2,"This is probably going to be pretty long so I'm going to have to skip over some details.

To start, I'm 21M, I've dealt with pretty bad social anxiety, depression throughout my life as well as selective mutism for a few years. As a result, I've had and still have zero friends nor am I close with my family, they support me but i don't really open up to them.

A few years ago my dad forced me to do something physical/social, ended up being Martial Arts. I never got into it and I never really made friends except with one guy the same age as me. I wouldn't have even called us friends, he simply volunteered to partner up with me and tried to be my friend but I shut him down.

Despite me being cold towards him and me just being weird in general he was still decent to me and we would still partner up in class. One day I had enough and stopped going, I didn't say goodbye to him.

All of that was a few years ago, I don't use traditional social media so I haven't heard from him until recently where we bumped into each other. We said hello and he asked me for my phone number which I gave him.

I thought he was just putting on a show and I didn't expect to hear back from him but he just contacted me a few hours ago asking to hang out and potentially stay the night.

I told him yes but I'm just confused about this whole situation. He's never seemed like a sketchy person but him inviting me to stay over after everything that happened just doesn't seem right to me.

On one hand I feel guilty for shutting him down and feel that I'm ready to start socializing more but on the other hand I'm afraid he has ulterior motives.

Currently 24 years old and I've been on 100 mg zoloft for the most of the year. I've been diagnosed with moderate anxiety and mild depression. I wish I could do therapy as well but unfortunately it's not in the funds.
 I just wanted to share my story in how I haven't had any social anxiety attacks in some time and that I wasnt fully aware that that's what I was having . I remember as a teenager in middle school being afraid to cough in front of the class for fear of everyone looking at me. When I turned 18 and got a job at a gas station, it helped with social skills and also having  friends helped . Although , I remember a few times feeling panicked,  face turning red , and heart palpitations and just having to remember to breathe and that it will pass. This would happen whenever there was slight conflict with customers or just when I wouldnt know what to say . I had no idea this was considered an anxiety attack and isn't just ""normal"" for everyone depending on the circumstances. I thought I was just easily embarrased.
Anyways I've noticed a change in my anxiety where I only get shy or embarrassed in appropriate settings whereas before I would become anxious in settings other people would just brush off.

So I went to a club close by.  Had a couple drinks and thought hey I'm going to try and talk to a chick tonight at a bar.  People do that right???  Sat down drinking and browsing reddit like a fucking loser.  Night goes on about an hour later I notice this chick alone at a table.  There were jackets on the chairs beside her.  She's with someone obviously don't do it says my brain.  FUCK IT I chugged my drink ordered another one and walked over....  made the worst small talk I've ever had... she gives me her snapchat....wtf is this I'm an ugly as loser and she isn't rejecting me?  Something is off.  Brain running through every reason why she is going along with it.  About an hour or two later she says she has to go meet her friend for a party...  fucking downer but I got her snapchat so...maybe we in?   Drinking talking to some random guy who approached me.  I see this goth chick alone.  Fuck it why not let's see if I can recreate this magic.  I order a drink to get ready. Turn around she is gone.  Wander around trying to find her.  Wind up running into the first chick again.  We talk a bit find out her friend ditched her.  We play pool and dance for the next 6 hours.  She asks me if I will be her new years kiss.  Fucking sure?  Pretty mediocre kiss but meh it's worth every second.  She keeps saying we should go back to her house and drink some more.

eileiu,If you're having issues say at work or in a group environment such as a club or friend group how do you unveil and confront people on their petty actions?,1b,help-seeking,2,"I work as a nurse and the place I'm at is filled with drama and emotional queens who want to let out drama when they want to only to get a high 5 from their friends for making fun of the person its fine to make fun of when that shouldn't be the case. Or do it to create more drama for the sake of it since they're bored. A newer co-worker who I'll name Sara has become a target of workplace bullying. Sara doesn't like getting involved or talk to the other girls in our department because within her first days of working there she noticed the drama and didn't want to involve herself.

Through this she became a target of mockery, ridicule, and at times some girls would even go out of their way to try and ""accidentally"" shove Sara. It doesn't get any better as there are some girls in HR who participate in causing these problems with my department. Issue is Sara has trouble standing up for herself and I'd like to help her confront the other girls but the problem is when you confront someone on their shitty behavior they either deny it or they'll say ""sorry I didn't know you felt that way"" or ""I didn't know I, my action, or that word made you feel like that..."".

It's in that they use those deceptive tactics to truly hid their intentions. In our work environment it's like an unspoken secret to target Sara to make life hell at work and to create drama with me. I get tired of it and cry for both my sake and Sara's. It's even a catch 22 as we try to be nice and cordial yet they fuck with us for doing that. We avoid them and then they fuck with us for doing that. I can't really look for another job as I need this one for my career. I want to stop this type of environment, the problem is that people will only stop doing something when given an incentive yet I find it hypocritical in that they preach to treat others with respect yet do the opposite and they know they're deliberately doing it just to make life amusing for themselves while miserable for others to boos their self-esteem.  What can I do to unveil this unspoken secret of targeting Sara and I also how do we confront them to unveil the truth?",giannaruth29-378,1,0,2,2020-01-01 18:08:09,socialanxiety

I started doing pretty well at some point. I got a job, found a way to speak to and get along well with my coworkers, and while I still get stuck on anything further than a greeting with a customer sometimes I‚Äôve managed to be able to make conversation and‚Äîif anything‚Äîjust continued to survive considering I assumed that as soon as I got a job I‚Äôd break down or something. So yeah, a big step in the right direction. 

The holidays come by, family visits for New Years and I remember how different from them I am. It‚Äôs always made me insecure how my family is so charismatic and cheerful talking to one another and laughing with no issue whatsoever. It‚Äôs comes so naturally to them. I had to give myself a pep talk so many times before they showed up because I didn‚Äôt want to be the same shy quiet rude kid I was before. I started off okay but it went downhill New Year‚Äôs Eve. I got drunk and sick and I reverted to just wanting to be alone in a safe space away from everyone else. Meanwhile, they continue partying and chatting away like it‚Äôs nothing. I think about joining but I can‚Äôt stand the feeling of their eyes on me. Makes me forget how to function almost and I almost always end up doing something rude because I want to get out of it as fast as possible.

So basically my whole life I have delt with a stutter that comes and goes depending on if I am anxious or depressed. It can get really bad to the point where I am almost unable to communicate with even close friends and family. But its not the kind of stutter where i get caught on a sound and people know im stuttering. Its the kind of stutter where i cant get any sound out at the beginning of a sentance or statment. For example: if someone were to ask me for my name when placing an order i almost always freeze and there is a long awkward pause where I am trying to say my name. It's totally humiliating. Especially  when trying to make a goof first impression.. BUT on the other hand if I'm feeling relaxed and things are okay I can sometimes go long periods of time without stuttering entirely. And infact can be fairly quick with small talk as long as im in the right setting/ mood with the right people. Recently though this had not been the case. I have been feeling as though I am digging myself deeper and deeper into a hole I won't be able to get out of.  Here is kinda where I am at now.
  I'm 23 and single but I havnt had a girlfriend since basically my junior year of high school.  in over 6 years. I have had 2 random hook ups in that time though.. spaced out between years. So defiently rare but maybe I'm not totally lost and i guess it could happen again. I am not the best looking dude around in my opinion. I unfortunately started rapidly balding at around 20 and now i am completely bald. And I honestly still havnt come to accept it. It totally bums me out actually because I feel like l not that long ago  was in high school with really nice hair. And now it's all gone.  But I'm more lonely than ever now . It's been years since any physical or emotional contact with a female. I feel like I don't have the capability to go out and meet new people like i used too. I always feel like I'm a follower and not a leader.   I feel as though i have nothing to offer and no future in sight. I am now working the most dead end pest control job. Its the least sexy job. I dont feel valued. It seems as though my relationships with my closest friends are dying out faster and faster and I slide deeper and deeper into this hole.

So I most just get anxiety when I'm around groups of people. Like at a BBQ or something, where everyone's sitting around a table and there's one big group conversation. If I know everyone well, I'm okay. But if there's people I don't know, even just one , I get really nervous and I just pray that nobody shines the group spotlight on me. My biggest worry is that they'll try and joke with me somehow, and I'll be caught off guard and come off as being humourless because I don't know what to say, or that my face will go all red because everyone's looking at me. 
The red face is the absolute worst because I feel like a lot of people are confused by it and then a lot of people, in my experience, will subtly ostrasize you. Like they won't be rude per se but they'll no longer pursue friendship with you, and your status goes down. It's happened in the past and the fear of it happening again is the reason for a lot of my social anxiety.

eiv3t1,Why am I always so nervous that people are going to actually harm me?,1b,help-seeking,2,"So over break, this kid I went to high school with hit me up and asked me if I was free over break, and I said yes. Ever since then I've had this near constant feeling of dread whenever I think about hanging out with him. I've tried looking for clues as to why I might be feeling this way based on his conversation cues, but I'm at a loss. 

**Backstory:** this kid and I have always had a kind of 'meh' history. He wasn't really my friend because he had some kind of problematic viewpoints that I disagreed with, but he definitely matured a lot towards the end of high school I guess. He did bail on being  my prom date on the day of prom, and he's always kinda been condescending and a little annoying, but that was then. I've kept him in my ""people from high school"" circles because A) we went to an EXTREMELY small school with a graduating class of 50 people and B)... his step sister is one of my best friends. 

To be blunt, I just have this bad feeling that he might want to hurt me. I'm increasingly afraid of radicalized men (incels, alt right) and this kid has always been a little morally ambiguous and hard to read at times. I'm just really fucking scared that he might want to hurt me or kill me, but I have no direct evidence of this. 

On the other hand, he could just be a kid from high school trying to reconnect with me. 

Here's the entirety of my text conversation typed out because it's 2 am and I can't sleep because this anxiety is tearing me apart: 

Him: u around over break

Me: Yeah I'm around til the 9th!

Him: Word do you want to do something on the 3rd?

Me: Yeah I'd be down         **\[why did i say this\]**

Him: Word. 

Me: What were you thinking of doing? 

Him: Was thinking we could grab dinner or do something simple

**\[I never responded to this\]**

Him: Do you want me to meet you there or do you want me to pick up

Me: whatever is easiest!           **\[Literally why the fuck did I say that\]**

Him: Picking you up would be easiest. What's your address?

**\[My DUMB FUCKING ASS GIVES HIM MY ADDRESS\]**

I then asked ""why did you want to hang out? Was there good \[name of our highschool\] drama? 

Him: ""I had free time and we haven't talked in a while. Outside of career moves, I'm not someone who holds secondary motives""

WHAT DOES THAT PART  MEAN???

I have no idea why I feel so afraid. Like he didn't say anything too weird. We've talked sporadically since we both went to college in 2017, usually just friendly interactions but he's usually kinda weirdly cold. Like he'll hit me up in response to something I say on social media and then when I respond he teases me about it. 

He also said my boyfriend looked like Elliot Roger. 

Which like, dude wtf. He always did have a certain knowledge of those types of people, and THAT'S WHAT SCARES ME. 

Why do I feel panicky and dreadful and like I should cancel hanging out? I made plans to hang out with his step-sister a week later so any chance of avoiding him won't work as I will see her and they live in the same house. 

A part of me thinks it could be a good time! A part of me thinks he genuinely just wants to catch up! But I have this problem where if I can't imagine how something is going to go, I get nervous that that means I'm going to die or something. I don't know why this is but I feel horribly anxious, and I don't know how to deal with this right now. 

Sorry for legit everything yeah you know how it is thanks sorry

**TLDR**

* Friend from high school hits me up out of the blue and asks to hang out. I say yes. I then remember that this kid has always been a little mysterious and I'm not sure I trust him. We used to be friends, but it's been a long time. And we have NEVER hung out one on one. 
* I have this irrational(?) fear of being harmed or worse. I am also like, acutely aware of incels. Yes I know that's kind of funny. But I'm worried he is/has become one, and wants to enact revenge on me for existing or something. Nothing in his texts really indicate that, but he does have a kind of odd texting style. 
* I'm best friends with his step sister but the two of them don't really get along and never have. I don't know why I have this panicky feeling and I want to cancel but I'm seeing his step sister a few days later and so he'll know that I just bailed for no good reason.
* I don't know why I feel this way or what to do.

eiv94c,How do i explain my social anxiety to someone? Feeling extremely anxious and awful at work because of my colleagues,1a,help-seeking,2,"I just wanna give a disclaimer that i‚Äôm not a native english speaker so please excuse any mistakes, thank you.

I‚Äôll try to be as brief as possible so here goes: 

After graduating from high school last year I wanted to do something fulfilling and give back to the community before eventually going to uni, so i decided i‚Äôd do a year of voluntary work. 
I work full time at a kindergarten and i‚Äôm being paid close to nothing, but that really isn‚Äôt the biggest issue.
What has turned out be an issue from the very beginning was that many of my colleagues, most above the age of 40, constantly belittle and treat me like a little child. 

It‚Äôs reached a point where my social anxiety has made a complete and horrible comeback in the worst way possible. I used to go to therapy to deal with it and in recent years i definitely have been able to keep it more in check and be more at peace with myself.  I‚Äôve stopped going to therapy because I was managing pretty well up until i started this job. 

Now every day feels like absolute torture and i just want out of here. Nothing is forcing me to stay here, it‚Äôs 100% voluntary work but i still feel awful about wanting to quit. I always feel like I‚Äôm on the verge of having a panic attack.
Working with children is such a rewarding experience but now i just feel stressed and alone and uncomfortable every single second i‚Äôm in that building. 

Now you might ask, why don‚Äôt i just speak to someone about this? Well unfortunately that‚Äôs... also an issue. 
I‚Äôve been meaning to speak to my supervisor about this for months but I keep putting it off because I‚Äôm terrified of having to explain why I feel the way I do and why my reactions are as extreme as they are. 
Does anyone here have experience in explaining your social anxiety in a work environment? 
I have no idea how to go about this, or where to even begin! I fear she‚Äôll just misunderstand and think I‚Äôm simply an introverted crybaby.",Tddypckr,1,0,7,2020-01-02 7:40:35,socialanxiety

There was no reason to do this.)  I'm disabled, I have autism spectrum and anxiety and CPTSD, and yet, she is claiming I  am harassing people now. (What??) she even got a witness; she is claiming I am pounding the walls and the floors and making excessive noise. I don't have a tv or stereo or a radio. I live alone. No kids, no loud pets. (If someone was hearing something, it may have come from somewhere else cause the walls are so thin but even my downstairs neighbor, who is friendly and was about, said there was no noise when I asked.) 

She's currently on vacation. I tried to approach her a couple times when my social worker was with me (I'm scared to approach people alone,) but I was going to ask if she could come to court as a witness or write something up for me (I ended up leaving a note.)

I need to approach my neighbor tomorrow, I need to approach one of my neighbors, he is very friendly and has a dog that I pay every time I see him walking by in the hallways, I'm really shy but I like animals and he says hello and he is friendly so I like him, but coming to someone's door to ask for something makes me feel really flighty and nervous and I feel like a nuisance and like I'm being pushy; what are the best times of days to approach someone so you're not bothering their personal time? And how should I ask for him to write up something for me? Realistically, I'm sure he wouldn't mind but we are only cordial with each other so it feels weird to ask something so personal but my lisian is getting annoyed at me cause she says ""just do it"" but it's so hard for me. I feel bad but ended up lying saying I already did it :( i need to do it tomorrow. Is 11 am appropriate time to talk to people? 

How can I approach him without feeling pushy or imposing? I can't sleep I'm so anxious!

And as many of you will know with anxiety comes a kind of self hatred. For me personally, if I were to leave the house I would over analyse how I look, how I smell, what I said to others, how I said them and the time after or before something, even during would be spent being so critical of myself and putting myself down to the point of depression. This led to me planning my suicide. Luckily medical professionals were there to help but I‚Äôve now realised they can only do so much. So this year I‚Äôve decided to take the advice of my therapist. To show compassion and understanding to yourself as you would for others. 

I have like a tick of some kind, where I would almost uncontrollably say that I hate myself, out loud. I have replaced that with I love myself instead and have felt so much better since. It seems little at first but the more it happens. The more I‚Äôm instilling something positive and better for my future mental health.

I just wanted to say to that whoever might see this. Stop being so hard on yourself. It‚Äôs not being self indulgent to be kind to yourself, it will only help you.

* When I first meet someone I can be confident but the next time I see them I act as tho they are not interested in talking to me
* It is difficult for me to talk to my coworkers because I don't bring that social energy. When I do say something I feel it is irrelevant and go back to being silent
* I can't stand being in a big event, especially with people I know. I try talking but I feel I mess up so I just hang out alone or with people I know as much as I can
* Whenever I feel inadequate, I come up with scenarios in my head. Sometimes I get the idea that everyone is against me which results in me feeling frustrated about something that may not even be the case
* I want to reach out to friends that I haven't talked to in a while but I feel if they wanted to talk to me they would have by now so I feel like I would just be bothering them
* I spend most of my time alone now because I feel I don't know how to talk to people (It is really hard for me.

He's always been the  creative one that is able to build things, knows his way around a toolkit,  and knows how to talk to people just right. I'm... not. I seem to fuck up the tiniest things and he gets understandably a bit frustrated. He tries to teach me how to do these things but I simply cannot. I learn very slow and it doesn't help that I have the added pressure of him watching over me. On top of this, I'm the son of the company owner. I have to look good... which puts more pressure on me and causes me to fuck up even more. 

This has caused me to get so goddamn scatterbrained that I end up messing up the tiniest things. I'll misinterpret basic instructions, screw up  The worst of these mistakes happened today and sent me into a downward spiral. I was told by my brother to call an inspector for a house that we had been working on. Again, all the pressure and stress just attacked me. I called them up and tried to leave a voicemail, but I got tongue tied due to the stress and then looked at my brother and said ""Shit, I fucked up how do I rerecord it?"" He hung it up for me and said I only had one chance- only for me to later learn that yes you can fucking rerecord a voicemail so nothing had to go this way. 

So the inspector got an incomplete, vulgar voicemail from the son of the goddamn company. And none of this had to happen. My brother had to call them back because my nerves were so shot by this whole thing that I could not bring myself to try again. And the worst part is I felt judged during the whole thing despite the fact he should know what this stuff is like since hes experienced it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think my anxiety got far worse after my last summer job. My dad was able to get me the job since he helped build the place, which seemed to piss off the management. They just did not like me from the start. From day one during training I was yelled at by the manager when I did not get things right- DESPITE IT BEING FUCKING TRAINING. Every shift someone would yell at me for something extremely trivial. On top of this, I was given a demotion with no announcement while one of my coworkers took my last job. I was barely scheduled, which caused me to struggle financially this past semester. The icing on the cake was when I cut my finger open on the last day and wasn't sent home until an hour after it happened when I told my manager that I probably needed stitches. I also never received workers comp despite the fact my finger could barely bend for some time and is still a bit tense. When I came in the following day to get my last pay check, my manager did not even acknowledge anything happened despite me still having a cast on my hand. 

When you spend a whole summer being severely devalued and treated like shit, you start to almost believe it. It makes you feel like you can't do much of anything right, and then this lack of confidence causes you to be more likely to screw up.

What I am though is obsessing all the time if people like me, if people are looking down on me, if people think I am a fake or not honest.

Because of this I am super aware of other peoples energy and very sensitive to it. I have trouble just accepting that not everyone is going to be my friend or like me, or I also seem to focus and be jealous of other people.

It's sad. It makes me constantly miserable, I spend to much time alone. I can't really make very many good friends, or at least close friends. 

Is this SA or sound like something else. So far I have looked around at possible c-ptsd, borderline. I definitely have classic anxiety and depression, panic attacks. Bad family history.

And I've been feeling a lot of mixed emotions for the party week. I think I need some help, but I don't have too much money to spend on a therapist. 

Maybe I'll give a little backstory. I was at my uncle's place and there's a language barrier for me so I was already feeling a little out of place. Which isn't unusual. But at one point my aunt was standing behind me with her hand on my shoulder and she was talking to my sister. Honestly that in itself made me pretty vulnerable and uncomfortable. But as her conversation went on the feeling just intensified until I started to pretend I wasn't there, and ignore a lot of what my sister and aunt were saying. To the point where they started talking to me, but I was not really responding to them. And I just had to step out with tears in my eyes. And I sent outside and started to violently cry..

eje652,How to kick social anxiety's butt?,1a,rant,2,"Hi Reddit!

I wanted to vent for a bit about my social shortcomings and that kind of jazz. This is because tomorrow I'm going to be moving countries in order to work on my Master's thesis. This is wildly exciting for me, because I love the research topic and can't wait for the change of environment. I also want to grab the opportunity to work on those shortcomings of mine. Being in a 'fresh' environment might give me a fresh state of mind, or so I'd like to think.

So I guess this feeling of anxiety I get from social situations is relatable to a lot of people. This cold hand squeezing your stomach at the very thought of it, mind racing. It sucks and even on good days it never really leaves you alone, pushing you towards being alone. And then when you actually give in to that feeling, you get this nagging, tiring thought in your head telling you you shouldn't be alone. You can't win!

Personally I have given in to this cold hand too many times. It has put a serious damper on my social skills. Looking back at earlier experiences, I think social skills are somewhat of a muscle. Use it often and it turns into a pair of big hunky biceps. Bunker up in your room and it withers away. Mine is currently a withered husk that really needs some life kicked into it. 

What I noticed recently is how much my behavior differs between people I am very close with, and those with which I am not. Though I often make social mistakes, when it happens to those I am close with it doesn't really bother me that much. I can brush it off. However, when somebody who's presence I enjoy, but I don't feel super close with (e.g. collegues or friends of friends) I just can't be myself. All I manage to do at that point is smile and nod, agree with everything they say. I become the world's most boring vocal mirror. Even though I like to think I'm an interesting person, there's nothing interesting or funny that comes to mind when I speak to them.

That feeds into one of my biggest fears, which is a one-on-one with another person. Whenever I am faced with the prospect of having to spend an hour with somebody alone, this cold hand doesn't just squeeze... it swipes and screams. I actively go out of my way to avoid any such situation. I think it is a fear of disappointing the other person. Having an awkward silence, being berated, or them thinking I'm a strange idiot. This is the thing that affects my negatively affects my life the most. I can't for the life of me carry a good or interesting conversation.

I know I can change and turn this around. I just need some pushes in the right direction. If anything comes to mind that you think might help me out, please share it with me. A piece of advice, a book on the matter, a good song... Whatever it is, I want to give it a chance. I want to get over this silly brain block.

ejeviw,Friendship Advice,1a,help-seeking,2,"I started this on New Year's Eve, didn't get around to finishing it until now. Better late than never. Apologies if this is all over the place, I don't know where to start.

I suffer from pretty bad anxiety, and very rarely (if at all) make first contact with someone because I'm paranoid that they don't like me. No exceptions to this rule, unfortunately. Even a ""hi, how are you?"" makes me feel like I messed up!

I have a friend who has become distant from me recently and I don't know how to feel about it. Over the last year, it's become obvious that he has no interest in continuing with the friendship, and I'm trying to move on but I'm finding it difficult because I'm always hoping he'll message me or something.

The turning point was when I asked him on a Sunday if he wanted to do anything during the following week and he declined. The very next day, he told me that he and a mutual friend were going out... in 15 minutes. I got 15 minutes notice after he declined the day before, so I assumed it was only an invite to save face. After that, I stopped messaging him and things fell apart from there.

I don't know what I want. I recently told him some of this but nothing has really changed so it's officially over, I'm just looking to be ok with it and move on with my life. I always felt like I was a burden to him so it's actually better for me.

Also, am I in the wrong for being upset with the turning point? My counsellor said I read too much into it but I really don't think I did.

ejfddk,The difference it can make when you feel supported and understood by those around you,1b,chitchat,2,"So let me preface this with saying that part of my social anxiety extends to me not being comfortable with being touched unless it's by my SO or very close friends. 
This post is meant to compare two similar situations and how the people around me reacted.

The first instance being a new year's party I went to with my sister and brother in law a couple of years ago where this random woman came up from behind me and gave me a rather enthusiastic hug without me being able to see who she was (not that it matters because I didn't even know her) and I quickly tried to break free which I had to do with a bit of force since her hug was essentially holding my arms down at my sides. I quickly backed away and my sister was shocked and started telling me how I was so rude and the girl got scared at my reaction and that I was so aggressive (completely ignoring how invaded I might have felt) and basically kept on making comments throughout the night of how aggressive and rude I am.


Now on to the second instance, a new year's party I attended this week with my SO and some friends. We were all standing in a small group and chatting as normal when a random dude almost double my hobbit height made a beeline towards me, arms wide open to hug me and at a fast pace.
I instinctively shrunk, put my hands out as to stop him and told him to please not hug me.
He stopped and looked at me weird, then looked around at my friends so as to get validation and got none, so he left.
SO then proceeds to ask me if I'm ok and pulls me closer as my friends tell me it's ok I didn't want to be touched by this random dude. I felt safe, validated and understood. 


Sometimes  it's the smallest things of what people around you say or how they react that can make or break the moment.
I am so thankful to be surrounded by people who can understand and respect my boundaries as opposed to being scrutinized for being ""rude"" for not wanting to be touched by complete strangers .

Just a thing I wanted to share, a moment that made me realize how important it is to be surrounded by the right people and how my boundaries are acceptable and not a flaw.

I was frustrated I couldn't get the words out (I even typed it out to help me and I was still too nervous). I fought through it to at keast admit I had something to say, to my boyfriend, and he really encouraged me. But I was so overwhelmed already with my nerves and frustrated I couldn't get the words out, and also relieved he was being patient and encouraging that I just started crying. It was embarrassing but I think I needed it. It turned out fine actually, but I just hate that I cry when frustrated. Happened once in high school IN class.

I've been suffering from social anxiety for 5 years now, having trouble talking to strangers even when it's just asking for informations like directions and stuff and in mid December I had enough and decided to book a one week trip to London to tackle my SA the hard way (I'm French so English isn't my native language and I'm not very good at speaking it especially orally). But my first day has been a total success (I landed yesterday), last night I was able to talk to strangers in a pub without needing to get drunk! Today I was able to ask for informations on how the subway works and asking for directions, I was able to order stuff at the restaurant and politely correct the waiter when he brought me the wrong order (something I would have never done in France, I would have just eaten the wrong order..).. Only downside is that I had booked my week in an Inn, it was a shared dorm with 15 other people, none of whom spoke English or French, it wasnt fitting and it was smelling terrible inside the dorm and it was very loud during the night but I had the courage of asking to check out early, went smoothly and to order an Airbnb stay in a total stranger's flat! I got a little anxious arriving at the flat but everything went smoothly with the host and I was able to hold a conversation with him and ask him some questions about his personal life and general informations about London! So first day went great and I'm pretty proud of myself, I find it easier to talk to people in a foreign language than talking to people in French.. I wanted to try and get out of my comfort zone and it's working so far, no need for alcohol, opioids or Xanax, it's only the first day and there are six more to go but  I really wanted to share my success story with someone as it's my first time travelling alone in a foreign country!

I‚Äôve been bullied my entire life, have been raised technically by a single mother, which I hate.

A man who is raised without a father/father figure isn‚Äôt masculine, doesn‚Äôt know how to fight, doesn‚Äôt know how to talk back verbally to people, and chooses to ignore/accept being harmed without doing anything. 

I‚Äôve already had fake groups of friends and they still affect my mind today.

It also pisses me off that I want to cry when typing this post.

People tell me I‚Äôm too nice, and shy. I hate it. People say I can change that but it‚Äôs impossible since I‚Äôve been raised like that my whole life.

The only person who I know how to fight and verbally talk to is my mother. I almost went to prison at the age of 15 because of that.

ejnwpb,About propranolol,1a,rant,3,"Hi, i have social anxiety and recently i have developed sort of a phobia of going to college. When i am there i feel always anxious and any conversation with classmates or friends, especially girls would trigger a panic attack. And it's worst during a class or when i have to do a presentation.  My anxiety is physical, my phobia now got worse and it became the fear of shaking in front of people. I took days off college and went back home and i feel better now. Leaving hometown to university this Sunday and i am very scared it happens again.... 

I started testing propranolol this week before i go out to .meet friends, i usually get nervous and sometimes my lips start twitching when i am the center of attention or arguing with someone with people around and suddenly all of that went away.  

I experimented with 10mg and it was good to eliminate the shaking, i have anxiety, and my heart rate is high even when at rest, high 70's sometimes i measure it in bed and could be up to 82bpm at rest... 

On 10mg, i feel nervous stomach and i still could feel hot under social pressure, if that even made sense, my English is not that well when expressing my self and lack some vocabulary.. 
20mg is good, 30mg was perfect, very chill but made me feel slight chest pain in the heart area when i breaty but went away eventually.. after few hours from taking the dose. Still, i am at home with friends and it's my comfort zone, so i don't think 10mg will be enough when i leave my city, away from all my friends and family, and  be  in college and surrounded by extremely extroverted people every day for 8+ hours...

I plan to take 20mg twice a day 5 times a week. One in the morning, and one at noon for my afternoon classes..  

These panic attacks are really holding me back, i want to study and have a good career, but my anxiety, plus this new phobia that never been there.. destroyed my confidence, i couldn't study anymore, my last days before i decided to take days off were horrible, i got anxiety attacks even in the street or paying for groceries waiting in line, i spent all day in bed, my heart felt like it would pop out my chest, and my whole body felt numb, something like if a panic attack is about to get triggered.. 




The point of me posting this, i want your opinions of how safe it is to use propranolol. Google says it's safe, some posts here on Reddit say it's safe, but what made me panic more and be scared to use this daily is some articles saying that it can cause sudden death and heart failure.

ejo1fl,Do I have social anxiety,1a,help-seeking,2,"Hi,

Thanks for reading this post and sorry if this is the wrong place for it but I'm relatively new to reddit. Basically I've started to notice 'signs' of social anxiety in myself and I'm really bad at opening up this kind of stuff in person so decided to ask on here so apologies if it sounds like I'm venting. I've always been quite a quiet person but still have maintained a very good social life and would consider myself outgoing which is why I'm unsure as to what I am experiencing recently. 

I can be chatty and sociable on a good day, however on bad days I get anxiety by just doing the most mundane things such as going into university to study, knowing I will bump into certain people. If people I'm not 100% comfortable with try to talk to me on my way in to university my mind will get overstimulated and I'll get flustered, go red and even sometimes notice myself sweating, trying to find my way out of the conversation as soon as possible. The same people that on a good day I will be able to hold a good conversation with and even consider friends (even some of my closest). It usually takes me a good 20 minutes to relax when this occurs. It's the facial flushing that worries me the most, on most days I try to wear as cool clothes as possible in order to avoid it and not look stupid. 

I have always had this to a much lesser extent but been able to control my anxiety well however recently I've noticed it has been a lot worse. I don't know what actions to take to avoid it or even if it is another problem such as a thyroid issue, as it has seemingly come out of the blue. Another weird thing is the few people I have told this to have said that I never seem flustered or anxious at all, which is how I feel most days!

Sorry if this comes across as a rant, any advice or any other help would be greatly appreciated.

ejp16k,I obsess and over-analyze every single damn conversation. I can't even talk with people anymore.,1a,rant,2,"I can't even talk with any of my buddies without choking up mid sentence then looking down to the ground in an embarassed manner, I panic to keep the conversation alive and for there not to be any awkward silence. 

Now I can't stop over-analyzing conversations even when watching movies and tv shows, someone says something then has to know exactly when to stop saying that thing then silence, wait for someone else to add something to what that person just said, then the other person says something else in relation to what he just said , so on so on, its driving me insane, whats the point of it all, just pointless blatter to pass the time and I do not get it, sort of reminds me of that Pulp Fiction scene when Mia says something along the lines of uncomfortable silence and why do we feel the need to yak about bullshit in order to feel comfortable. 

Just one big combination of words and facial expressions, and if you don't know how to do it you are screwed, it is the only damn way to freaking do anything, get your point across, express ideas, everything! And I can't freaking do it, why can't we be like other animals and communicate by sniffing each other or some shit. 
This problem is ruining my life, I can't even talk to my parents for godsake without nitpicking what words I should use and when the conversation is ready to end and we can stop using our vocal cords and do some other useless human bullshit. 

Although I do have good days when conversations just flow naturally, but then I always realize mid conversation, oh shit ain't I supposed to be panicking right now, and that usually ruins it and I become awkward and weird. I feel like the solution to a lot of life's problems is just simply being good at conversations, and having a good conversation with someone is amazing, I haven't had one in forever, any rare occasion I actually have a good conversation without stuttering I usually want to rush to get the hell away from that person before I can somehow ruin this good conversation. When I get this sort of anxiety I just come off as rude or weird, stuttering, obviously lacking in confidence.

ejs2xv,Race Based Social Anxiety?,1b,rant,3,"My social anxiety is rooted in a lot of different things (such as believing I'm ugly, my low toned voice, my smile, etc.), but today I remembered one of them, being my anxiety of being a different race, mainly around upper class white people/hipsters.

I believe it stems from internalized racism I got from my dad, who also has his own issues with internalized racism. I'm East Asian, my dad grew up here in NYC as one of the few asian kids in his class, his neighborhood, etc. However, the world of NYC that my dad grew up in is different than today's, as racism was open back then, and just about every other non-PC thing you could think of. My dad's a racist (and sexist himself, oh boy internalized sexism issues too but that's for another post), and growing up he told me a lot of things about how white people would never accept asians as equal, that we're different and that's that. Yes it is true that one cannot assimilate and shouldn't purposefully try to assimilate and erase their cultural heritage. But the way my dad put it made it sound like every well off white person was looking down at me because I'm just another asian who isn't sophisticated and is stealing their kids good schools, jobs, etc, etc.

I go to school in a very white hipster, upper class neighborhood and only today has this paranoia of people looking down at me and judging me for my looks (my brain holds this irrational belief that I'm a stupid ugly asian person who people will assume I won't get cultural references and that I'll never be a part of their world aka thanks dad for instilling this belief in me), just really come out of nowhere and affected me.

It was when I went to Barnes &amp; Noble and bought a school required book and a self-help book on Perfectionism that triggered this comeback. (my social anxiety has been relatively on the low down for the past 2 years, it was horrific in middle school and 9th grade, never got treatment and I am still not being treated for any of my mental health struggles). I went to the register with $30 prepared in my hand so that I wouldn't have to awkwardly fish it out of my wallet when the total actually came out to $50 for 2 books. Idiot me left about $100 in a red envelope in my book bag from Christmas and my mind was telling me the whole time ""wow, white dude probably thinks you're from another neighborhood and just another awkward asian lmao you're so ugly right now btw, I bet he thinks all asians dress bad like you"". I was slightly dissociated/zoned out from my surroundings so I didn't hear his initial greeting asking ""Did you find what you were looking for?"" so I assumed he said if I had a membership so I nodded no. Which turned out to be very awkward....Anyway after grabbing 3 $20 bills I realized I overpaid him by $20, and that was another hit to my psyche. 3 awkward incidents with my brain mocking me for proving to myself I haven't changed and 'validating' all those irrational beliefs I hold.

I went home today and obsessively examined every photo of myself I have from the start of high school and just felt disgusted by my appearance and physical differences.

Anyway sorry this post is sort of disorganized, but I really don't know how to deal with this racial-based social anxiety, and idk where to find resources on dealing with this. Has anyone ever researched this, created specific methods on dealing with it, etc.? Is there even a name for this besides what I'm calling it?

I was socially awkward, unable to defend myself (in an argument), nor did I have self value, and a cried... a lot. I hated all this things about me mainly for one reason - it made my life ineffective and more difficult than it should have been. I have become muchhhhh more social, and I am almost popular in my school (I could have a dated some popular girls, but every time we get close I fuck it up with what I think are intimacy problems). And I think people think I‚Äôm funny (atleast they laugh when I say jokes in class). Anyway, lately, I‚Äôve been having this thing that I‚Äôve been getting hella nervous in public. I would feel like I‚Äôm crying but no tears would come out. Then since I‚Äôm embarrassed, my eyes would feel like they‚Äôre burning, and they‚Äôd get a bit teary, but usually I will squint to make the tears go away. I hope to god it doesn‚Äôt look like I‚Äôm crying, hopefully, it looks like I‚Äôm just uncomfortable. I am simply unable to live in the moment. There are times in life that I had to get mentally heated and start yelling at an asshole that was verbally attacking me, and I was unable to do it. I froze. I have no problem in physical fights because my adrenaline takes over, and I‚Äôm a quite physically fit person, but I cannot USE my voice. I got that goddam feeling of crying without tears. And the eye burn thing. I HATE it. Also, I have this fear that everyone at my school hates me. Well, I will over analyze one small incident, then I will assume everyone hates me. Then the next day, I will over analyze another incident, and assume everyone loves me. Also, I hate myself. I think I‚Äôm a huge asshole.  Well, that‚Äôs it I guess. Can anyone tell me their experience will the eye burning thing. I‚Äôve looked at myself in the mirror when it‚Äôs happened before and my eyes didn‚Äôt look bloated like they do when I cry.

ek2x1n,Do I have social anxiety?,1a,help-seeking,2,"Hi,

Thanks for reading this post and sorry if this is the wrong place for it but I'm relatively new to reddit. Basically I've started to notice 'signs' of social anxiety in myself and I'm really bad at opening up this kind of stuff in person so decided to ask on here so apologies if it sounds like I'm venting. I've always been quite a quiet person but still have maintained a very good social life and would consider myself outgoing which is why I'm unsure as to what I am experiencing recently.

I can be chatty and sociable on a good day, however on bad days I get anxiety by just doing the most mundane things such as going into university to study, knowing I will bump into certain people. If people I'm not 100% comfortable with try to talk to me on my way in to university my mind will get overstimulated and I'll get flustered, go red and even sometimes notice myself sweating, trying to find my way out of the conversation as soon as possible. The same people that on a good day I will be able to hold a good conversation with and even consider friends (even some of my closest). It usually takes me a good 20 minutes to relax when this occurs. It's the facial flushing that worries me the most, on most days I try to wear as cool clothes as possible in order to avoid it and not look stupid.

I have always had this to a much lesser extent but been able to control my anxiety well however recently I've noticed it has been a lot worse. I don't know what actions to take to avoid it or even if it is another problem such as a thyroid issue, as it has seemingly come out of the blue. Another weird thing is the few people I have told this to have said that I never seem flustered or anxious at all, which is how I feel most days!

Sorry if this comes across as a rant, any advice or any other help would be greatly appreciated.

ek7yoz,How to manage social anxiety in small settings?,1a,help-seeking,2,Okay so I‚Äôm an introvert and I have social anxiety but I wouldn‚Äôt say it is enough to be considered a disorder. See I only experience social anxiety in smaller group settings rather than a crowd. I can do parties at clubs if I actually want to go but usually I don‚Äôt since I‚Äôm a homebody. When I was in college I didn‚Äôt mind clubs as much but the older I get the more of an extreme introvert and homebody I become. It‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt feel like I have much in common with people anymore. I can do crowds like I can take my daughter to the fair without any issues. With my job I work in social services so I have to talk to people. I have no issues talking to people one on one or in smaller groups at work since it‚Äôs work but if it‚Äôs something outside or work like a small social gathering I become extremely anxious when I feel pressured to have small talk which as you know I don‚Äôt care about since I‚Äôm an introvert. Most of the time I can pull it off or maybe get on my phone to distract myself but usually I am ready to leave after an hour or two. Today I was with my boyfriends side of the family and his family are the complete opposite from my family. Even though my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years I still don‚Äôt feel comfortable around his family and probably never will. They are nice people don‚Äôt get me wrong I just cannot connect with these people. But anyways my boyfriends brother passed away and they had a family gathering at their family house. I went to support my boyfriend even though I didn‚Äôt really want to go. But anyways it‚Äôs like my boyfriend want me to connect with his family so badly he just forces me to be in uncomfortable situations with them. Their family house is rather small. When we pulled up to the house I kid you not it was like 20 cars parked outside. I dreaded getting out of your car.  I go in the house and it‚Äôs completely packed to the point it is hard for people to walk around. I found a seat in the kitchen and I was okay sitting there for the first couple of hours. Then my boyfriend made me go into the living room where it was more packed and had me sit in between two people on a small couch. So now I‚Äôm completely uncomfortable with no personal space. I try to play it off and smile to look like I actually wanted to be there. I really wasn‚Äôt trying to offend his family since they just suffered a tragic loss. So his family is talking really loudly over me and all. I start to become tense. Then if that is not bad enough his mother put me on the spot in front of everyone asking me why I was so quiet and that they‚Äôre a loud talking family in a very condescending way like you have to act like us. I literally wanted to cry. A couple of people spoke up and was like she‚Äôs observant and just has to get comfortable but his mom is like well it‚Äôs been 2 years. I sunk in my seat speechless. I mean how do I explain my personality and anxiety to a group of strangers and then that wasn‚Äôt even the time or the place. I was just ready to go. This is pretty much why I probably hang with his family like once or twice a year. It‚Äôs unbearable and my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt understand he just dismiss it as it I just don‚Äôt want to give people a chance. So what can I do about this?

This crippling fear of colleagues having negative feelings towards me. And they do. Currently dealing with someone at work who hates my guts and finds fault in literally everything I do even though she herself sucks balls at her job. I hate her just as much but it doesn't erase the crippling, mind numbing anxiety I feel going to work every day just because of her. I have had a similar situation in every job I've ever had so far.

I am prepared to quit this job just because of this person but I know that there is probably always going to be at least one person who dislikes me. I can't quit every job. I know Im not always the most likable person in professional environments. I've struggled horribly with professionalism for my entire career so far and I'm almost 28. I try exceptionally hard at my job and do the best I can. I really don't think I am bad at my job (teacher). But this person seems to think I'm the scum of the earth, and even the principal has spoken to me about needing to ""step it up"". I know I'm anxious and kind of shy, but I believe I do an excellent job in guiding my kids and I have great relationships with most of them. The way I interact with my kids is NOTHING like the way I interact with the adults. Anyway off topic, getting defensive here but yeah. Just feeling so much terror at professional social situations.

My anxiety is also I'm sure one of the things that makes me unliked, ironically.

It is just unbearable to me, the thought of someone disliking me. I over analyze and dwell on the most insignificant and minutely of negative moments with another colleague. I have no idea why. I do struggle with this in every day relationships too but not on nearly such an intense level.

ekdsyr,I‚Äôm kinda scared of my own mind and problems that are piling up.,1a,rant,2,"I don‚Äôt know how to start this off.

I‚Äôm not a person to engage in a conversation or even want one. Hell, I‚Äôve barely enough energy to play D&amp;D, not to mention DMing a game. 

I always try and preoccupy myself, with the aforementioned D&amp;D, games like Elite Dangerous and taking up an acoustic guitar and lately I‚Äôve noticed that I was subconsciously distracting myself(funnily enough with everything *but* school) to avoid really talking to myself. I try and act social by putting that smiling mask on that is my public character(I try and be weird and wonky, happy and supportive so that people don‚Äôt go through what I‚Äôm going through) but when it‚Äôs off and I actually try and talk to myself it never happens. I always try and distract myself, with songs(Like *Paranoid* that I can really relate to), with games that take a while so that I won‚Äôt have to really think much, and with the small group that I call friends which is expanding.

Love never worked for me. Ever since 5th grade(I‚Äôm now 12th grade) it really barely worked only once, with a girl that dated me for attention and I got cheated on after 3 days of relationship. But it always occurred that my own attractive friends are the ones that really ‚Äútake‚Äù the crushes I barely have chances with. From a girl in the 5th grade, to the 7th, 8th and 11th. And I always say ‚Äúok, it makes them happy and I‚Äôm ok with it since that‚Äôs my end goal.‚Äù But my kindness and affection always makes me That Friend. You know, the one with the advice and affection that *isnt* the boyfriend. and in any other situation I‚Äôm ok with and I‚Äôm glad to be that friend but I‚Äôve done it 3 times by now. And my heart was crushed 3 times now and it‚Äôs really sad


Since the friend‚Äôs group expanded, I‚Äôve been falling into this nice girl. And she seems fucking amazing! With throwing tons of compliments, to being really friendly and actually making it so I‚Äôll have a chance but it just got ruined again cause she‚Äôs in love with my best friend and now they‚Äôre dating. 4th time I‚Äôm That Friend now.

Every time it happens and honestly it just keeps crashing on me every single time. I don‚Äôt really know how to deal with this and my mind always tells me to do somethings that I don‚Äôt think are good for me which is why I‚Äôm here in seek of aid. Probably the wrong sub( r/depression seems up this post‚Äôs ally) but in truth I just want advice. Anxiety keeps piling alongside shit love-life and decreasing grades, not to mention being emotionally struck by some family things and my friends constantly pushing me aside.

Whenever I am in a social situation my heartbeat starts to rise, my hands get shaky, my eyes get watery, my voice cracks and eventually my voice just stops coming out.

There was only a total of 8 of us in the room, and when I started reading my voice came out fine and I was calm. Then I suddenly felt my heartbeat increase, my eyes got watery and my voice started to sound like I was trying not to cry. Even for a good 15 minutes after that my hands kept shaking. I'm tired of this happening all the time, I ended up calling in today just because I was scared of having to read in front of the others again. Another example is when I first started this job there was a few of us who started together and we were asked to introduce ourselves one at a time. While everyone there was introducing themselves it took everything I had to not run out of the building and quit on my first day. I felt so scared while waiting for my turn and was even thinking I would rather be dead right now. I remember my leg was shaking uncontrollably and I kept trying to think of what I was going to say.

One of the common things people suggest when it comes to improving social skills is books on overcoming shyness/anxiety, or links to youtube videos. While these are great resources to learn a skill, one can only internalize it by taking action. And massive amounts of action.

Improving upon your social skills is 'simple', but not always 'easy'. The internet is filled with watered down BS articles on how you should 'just be yourself' and 'love yourself', but hardly ever telling you the exact steps that you need to 'execute' to achieve that state.Not everyone tells you the beautiful and painful process of actually realizing what you read/learn from self-help.

And execution is where most ideas fail. We don't wanna leave our comfort zone. Who wants to leave their cozy couch, and go out among lots of people and actively try to engage. Who wants to feel that crippling fear that you get when you are in front of someone, your mind goes numb not knowing what to say, and you smiling sheepishly creating an awkward vibe.

And that os OKAY! What we fail to realize is all that awkwardness and fear we face each time is training our social muscles. We become stronger each time.

Think to yourself, what is the biggest problem you are facing right now with your social skills? And what would you become if you overcome that?

Then go out and win it my friend. Love to hear from y'all!",hummus_wolf,1,0,4,2020-01-05 22:24:59,socialanxiety

eklaue,Social anxiety? Panic attacks? Why does this happen and what is going on?,1a,help-seeking,3,"Is this social anxiety? Are these panic attacks? Someone please provide insight on what I am experiencing.

Have worked in my profession for 2 years now but the last two months have become crippling and debilitating to the point where going to work is terrifying. However, in general, this has been happening to me. Like if I was to run into someone I knew enough to say hi to in the grocery store, this would straight up happen during a convo and I can‚Äôt figure out how to avoid it. I am so terrified to talk to people I do not know so I don‚Äôt and then get super nervous to talk to people I barely know since I typically avoid them. 

This is what happens to me during small/friendly talk with people in my office or sometimes in public when facing strangers/people I know. It also occurs during important meetings or arrangements when the spotlight is on me. This very strange sensation onsets and eventually dissipates when the ‚Äúthreat‚Äù is gone. It HAS to be a panic attack but people have told me they do not think it is that. It is not as severe when I have been drinking but I would rather not become an alcoholic. 

My mind and body essentially shut down during small/friendly talk with co-workers or meeting new people (sober). Its this sensation that strikes me at once and my adrenaline skyrockets, mind and thought processes become completely blank, all memory dissolved, head becomes completely lightheaded, eye contact is literally impossible to make, vision blurs (tunnel vision), all of my senses shut down, body tingling, and body temperature increases. It feels like I am on acid, my body and mind go into complete shock and panic mode. During the episode, if it has carried on long enough, sometimes it has gotten so bad (like in front of my VP‚Äôs - notably, extremely important people to my profession) that I feel like I am on the verge of fainting (although I have never fainted) and I have no choice but to close my eyes, tuck my head in my hands, and let out this moderately volumed, uncontrollable sigh. Literally has happened in front of fucking executives at my company. It is like a social defense mechanism my body automates. I always play it off as an unexpected sharp pain in my head and tell them how I get very frequent migraines and not to worry (usually works and they walk away). 

Found this video/article that seems to portray exactly what happens to me. https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-08-16/dr-benjamin-habib-on-news-breakfast-in-2016./11414128. Please read/watch; I can literally feel every sensation he is experiencing in this video. 

I would also like to mention how I always feel ‚Äúout of it.‚Äù After reading Reddit today, I learned this is called ‚ÄúBrain Fog.‚Äù This has also heavily worsened and I can no longer focus at work. I am constantly just thinking about ways to fight my anxiety on a minute-by-minute basis; constantly worrying about what I would do in a plausible social situation at work that I could incur at any point throughout the day. I am having trouble learning/retaining new info because of the brain fog. 

What is going on with me? Why does my body seize up? Why do I constantly feel groggy and anxiety ridden? I am fit, exercise regularly, and eat super healthy (in attempt to combat my anxiety) but always feel shitty. How is it all of a sudden just worse after 20+ years of social interaction? Why is it like I was born yesterday and am straight dumb during conversations? I have my damn masters in engineering, why won‚Äôt my mind let me use it effectively in these situations?

Hoping its because I have PMO‚Äôd since I was 12. I have given up fapping and am 6 days clean. Hope this proves to be effective.",SalientLeaf,1,0,20,2020-01-05 23:53:24,socialanxiety

Social anxiety has made this so much more prevalent in my life, maybe if I had the social skills or confidence to talk to my co-workers then it'd be easier but it's just gotten worse.

I'm a 19/f working with middle-aged men, and I am so fucking awkward around them, I can't hold a conversation and I'm constantly on edge. Some of them make fun of me for it and some just feel blatantly uncomfortable around me.

I've had two instances where people have expressed concern about my mental well-being because of the way I act. It's destroying me. I want to quit anyway, but this is pushing me over the edge. I don't know if it's natural to be so socially inept with people so different to you, or if I should be able to carry a conversation with someone so inherently different to me, but regardless. I don't know what to do, I'm lost and I've tried and tried but 12 months later, I still have made no progress. Any progress I do make makes me feel more confident for a few days until I get knocked back down further than I was before.

ekpi99,Just had a good cry and need help...,1a,help-seeking,3,"To anybody who takes time to read this thank you....

I'm 28 and so tired of my social anxiety. 

Backstory-
Mother left for drugs and another man so father took it out on me, verbally, physically, and emotionally abused until I moved out at 20.
Social anxiety flared up at 16 causing me to avoid school and started drinking early to cope. Barely graduated high school and developed major avoidance issues. 
Had several jobs but can't stay at a job for more then a year usually because my social anxiety is worse around people I have been around longer and after I get too anxious I usually just leave and don't have it in me to give a notice. 
Tried college and dropped out because of my crippling anxiety and having to do speeches and anything performance related.
Tried different psychiatrists and ssris and just gained weight after different ones and still unable to feel like a ""normal"" functioning person. Then I got a hold of benzos which took the edge off but after feeling super depressed decided to drink harder...
Went to rehab after being hosptialized for being suicidal and abusing benzos and alcohol which the place I went to didn't help a bit. I was with a bunch of crazies, no offense and was doped up on meds like a zombie. 
Tried recovery groups and support groups but too anxious to share so stopped going...
Despite terrible relationships I did manage to get married to a great guy who I have been with for 7 years and have a beautiful fun 5 year old with however sometimes I feel foreign with my husband as he can't understand my social anxiety...most days I feel he can do better then me.
Let me get to the point why I really just broke down and I don't cry as I usually feel numb with the only other feeling being anxiety if that makes any damn sense?
Currently I do have a job as a new patient coordinator over the phone for a general wellness clinic going on 8 months with that I call a blessing because I make good money but I drink every day at work to deal. I am not proud of this and feel ashamed. I work 12 hour days and am mentally drained trying to talk to people all day and get people to schedule as I have goals to meet. I usually work alone except one day so I find peace in that but fear I have to have social interaction with coworkers which most of them are great. Recently we started doing meetings and role playing was brought up for the love of god. If I try to make a speech I shake, can't think straight, my lip quivers. It is extremely embarrassing. 
Tonight my boss who is pretty laid back as long as we bring in patients calls me twice asking where we are at with scheduling. It wasn't very good and I was trying but I could hear in his voice what sounded like disappointment and I was unable to communicate efficiently. I'd like to think that I'm intelligent but when anxious my heart pounds, mouth gets dry, have trouble breathing, and can't make out what I want and need to say as if my brain is mush. When I'm buzzing I am outgoing and basically a functioning alcoholic. I was not buzzing for the first time I had to interact with him and I feel like a failure like am I going to be able to keep this going. I try not to think so much about the way I am because if I do I will cry. I hate myself for the way I cope and not seeking help earlier in life when my anxiety flared up and I started avoiding and drinking. I feel so hopeless because I feel like I will always need some substance to just feel okay. I do what I have to do to get by but I feel disgusted with myself for pouring alcohol in soda bottles to function. It's only getting worse and I'm only getting more tired. I feel like I'm letting my daughter down that her mama is weak because I have to drink to go to her school functions and be there for her. I am a good mom despite everything, I teach her self love and do everything I can to help her not be like me. She is so bright and I encourage her even though I feel like I barely love myself and a hypocrite. My health insurance sucks and I want to get help but I don't know what to do and I don't want to get admitted involuntarily somewhere. I know I can't keep this up I'm killing myself slowly and know the way I cope is unhealthy. I can't bring myself to tell people these things about me because I feel so ashamed but I want to break this vicious cycle.

ekqnuc,What are you going to do in 2020 to overcome social anxiety?,1a,help-seeking,2,"I'm 26 and I'm determined to fucking get over social anxiety this year, I've realised that I need to build momentum with exposure therapy just like building other habits like exercising, eating well etc. 

It's tough at first, I feel like I almost have to dissociate sometimes just to stop overthinking but I'm getting to a point where I don't hesitate to say yes to invitations or approach people. I still overthink in the build up to planned events but it's getting better each time as I realise the worst case scenarios I come up with in my head are never the reality. 

For example whenever a friend invites me to something my immediate thoughts are:

* I'll come off as awkward
* I won't know what to say, there will be awkward silences
* They won't like me anymore after this particular interaction

But honestly none of this is gonna kill me, it's not my responsibility to completely maintain a conversation and even if they think I'm awkward they invite me out anyway so they must enjoy my company. And even if they don't and I never see them again, it doesn't define my value as a person or ability to be liked.

This caused me to blush a little which then they picked up and started shouting HAHAHA ""jack"" (changed name) why are you going red, omg look at him go red which of course made me go bright red and I felt really hot, started sweating in front of all the users, it was so embarrassing and I can't stop thinking about it.

ekyiuk,Confrontation on my driveway project,1b,help-seeking,1,"Being an introvert means you want to avoid confrontation at all costs. Well I just screwed myself into a sticky position. I hired a local construction company to fix my driveway. Long story short, my driveway was basically a cliff and my car scraped each time I went up it. So I met this dude at my property for a consult. He said he was going to dig out the existing concrete, install drains and level the driveway. He got there this morning and texted me pics of the finished product at noon. It looks great, but no drains, and it doesn't look like he dug any of the concrete out that was causing the problem. So now I'm left with this, I haven't paid him yet. We are planning on meeting up tonight at a gas station to exchange payment. I want to see what's up, but scared of the confrontation. Adulting sucks, but being an introvert on top of that is horrible. any suggestions on how I should approach this?",Torileighh97,1,0,2,2020-01-06 19:02:08,socialanxiety
